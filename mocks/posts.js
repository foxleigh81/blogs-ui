                "title": "100 Healthy Days",
                "body": "I&apos;ve been doing super-well on achieving my 2017 goals so far this year and this is motivating me to achieve as many of them as possible. Goal 1 of my 2017 goals is the same as goal 1 of every other year since I started this in 2012: Get to a healthy weight.\n\n\n\nI&apos;ve done a lot over the years to help with this,\n\n- I&apos;ve learned to love vegetables where before I had practically zero veg in my diet, I now have a lot.\n- I&apos;ve given up sugary drinks &emdash; I still have the occasional fanta but you can probably count the number of fizzy drinks I have per year on my hands now where before you would have probably needed a super-computer to calculate them. My main drinks now are water and sugarless tea/coffee. Still with milk though. If I want a treat, I&apos;ll get some fruit juice but I try to make that an irregular thing.\n- I&apos;ve (mostly) given up heavily processed foods &emdash; I used to be a ready-meal addict, these days I cook a lot more things myself and even when I don&apos;t, I go for quick assembly items which are usually not full of chemicals and e-numbers. In fact there used to be a time where my freezer was full and these days I can go weeks without even opening it.\n- For my efforts, I&apos;ve gained weight and now stand at 250lbs which is exactly where I was at the start of my last major attempt to lose weight when I recorded my &apos;Developer on a Diet&apos; YouTube series. As you might imagine, this is tremendously frustrating and makes me wonder if somehow my body works in reverse.\n\nSo I&apos;m going to try one more thing before I concede that I must be some sort of backwards alien and drown myself in Big Macs and Oreo milkshakes.\n\n## I&apos;m going to join #100healthydays\n \nI&apos;ve got to be honest, I naively thought I&apos;d come up with this myself, I&apos;ve been doing the #100happydays hashtag on instagram for a while now (currently on day 87) and I had the idea of kick starting a new ritual of healthy eating by applying the same logic to health as I did to happiness. So I googled 100healthydays and found that someone beat me to the mark. However, like I have discovered with other dieters, they usually started at a weight below my TARGET weight and indeed, before she began she weighed 196lbs.\n\nLike with my &apos;Developer on a Diet&apos; experiment, I was more interested to find out what this sort of thing would do to a completely sedentary and lethargic person who is seriously overweight.\n\nSo my variation on 100healthydays will be a little different and I&apos;ve given myself some specific rules to follow:\n\n### 1: No Processed meats\n\nNow, &apos;processed&apos; is a bit of a vague term, diced chicken is technically processed food so it&apos;s hard to follow this one to the letter, needless to say I&apos;m referring to things like bacon and ham. The point of this is to make sure I know what I&apos;m putting into my body.\n\n### 2: No added sugar\n\nThis means that I can&apos;t put sugar in anything but I can eat things that have sugar in already. 100 days without the occasional chocolate bar or doughnut just won&apos;t happen so there is no point in kidding myself. Plus as I&apos;m going to attempt to get close to veganism, I need to give myself a treat sometimes but no more sugar in tea (I&apos;d just quit that anyway), no sugar on cereal and no sugar on fruit.\n\n### 3: At least 2 100% vegan days per week\n\nAs I get used to this one (which I&apos;m presuming I will) I will probably increase it to a higher number but at the start of the challenge I want to give myself time to ease into it and I think 2 days is completely manageable.\n\n### 4: At least 1 100% veg meal per day\n\nOn days I&apos;m not feeling it, this will be just a bowl of corn flakes but ideally this will be a main meal.\n\n### 5: Be active at least 30 mins a day\n\nI suck at getting out and walking when I&apos;m not in the office and that is something I need to change. I suspect this will get easier as the days progress and will be very hard at the start. I can easily spend 30 mins in VR though and that can be knackering if I do it right.\n\n### 6: Keep a public food diary\n\nI&apos;m using myfitnesspal for my food diary as I&apos;ve used it on and off for years and I find it very useful. I&apos;ll also be posting regular journal posts which will also have a food diary in it.\n\nYou can see my MFP diary here: http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/foxleigh81\n\n### 7: Do a weekly health check\nAt the start of this process I did a health check. This involved checking my weight, body fat percentage, visceral fat and muscle mass. I&apos;ll do this every week, usually on a Sunday unless I forget.\n\nMy first health check results will be posted as part of my journal later on.\n\n### 8: No more than 5 cheat meals\n\nAs this plan focuses on a healthy lifestyle, I don&apos;t see me doing many of these cheat meals anyway. The only things that would be against the rules would be things like going to McDonalds or having a bacon butty. I&apos;m sure I can live without these things, at least for 100 days so I&apos;m only going to allow myself 5 slip-ups.\n\n### 9: &apos;Junk&apos; food must be home-made (or purchased from a high quality restaurant)\n\nThis basically means that I need to get my food from high quality sources, so no more fast food establishments for junk food. If I want pizza I need to either make it myself or go to a good quality pizza restaurant (sorry pizza hut, you&apos;re out).\n\n### 10: Drink at least 2 litres of liquid a day\n\nAt the moment I&apos;m pretty bad at getting my liquid intake, I can often go a full day on one coffee and a bottle of water. So my goal is to increase that to something a bit healthier.\n\n## Holding myself accountable\n\nWhen it comes to my personal health, I&apos;ve got very little will-power, however I don&apos;t like to fail and I certainly don&apos;t like it when those failures are public so I&apos;m going to share my journey over the next 100 days (well 96 days as I&apos;m technically already on day 4 &emdash; sorry, I&apos;ve been ill) on the following places:\n\nThis blog will be the place you can receive detailed updates about my progress, I probably won&apos;t post daily but I will post as often as possible, I&apos;ll also post my journal updates to here which I&apos;ll make sure I do at least a few times a week.\n\nInstagram is where I&apos;ll be the most prolific as to be a part of the #100healthydays hashtag you need to post to it daily. So expect a lot of pictures of meals and the great outdoors and maybe as the days pass, some progress photos too.\n\nYouTube will be where you can watch any videos I make. I have attempted to do a video blog of diet progress before but that was on an old YouTube account, however if you are interested, you can still watch those here.\n\nFinally, as I mentioned earlier, I&apos;ll also be keeping a public food diary on MyFitnessPal, so you can keep tabs on me there.\n\n## If I fail\n\nRules are no good unless there are consequences to failing them. So should I not make it to the end of the 100 days or if I have more than 5 meals that break the rules then I need to pay a price. That price will be a £150 donation to the Conservative party. I&apos;m very anti-tory and I&apos;d actually feel sick knowing that I helped them so that&apos;s a big penalty for me.\n\nI&apos;ve got some moral support from my lovely wife as she is joining me on my journey but any support you can give me will be great too, every little helps!\n\nWish me luck!",

                "body": "I've not exactly made leaps and bounds with my 2012 goals but I have made some progress and they are coming along nicely. Here is what I have done so far:\n\n## Health\n\nI am still going to my martial arts classes, I have now officially signed up after my trial ended and I'm looking forward to receiving my white belt next week, I also have a black belt but that came free with a pair of jeans so I doubt they will let me wear it. Even after only three weeks I can already feel a great deal of difference, if I ignore the fact that I am constantly aching, I feel much better than I did when I started, my fitness level has already noticeably increased, if my progress continues at this rate then I have do doubt that by the time this year ends I will have the body I  have wanted to have for most of my life.\n\nI have also invested in a set of weights and a pull-up bar, I've noticed that outside of my classes I am only using the cross-trainer and - as my legs are generally aching like crazy from the kick boxing - I do not use that as much as I should, my arms and upper body generally feel OK after the work out though so I have decided to work on those as well.\n\n## Environment\n\nI have assessed the space available to me in my apartment and drawn the conclusion that it's just not enough, as I love my apartment dearly and have no desire to move I have decided to rent some storage space instead. I managed to get a pretty good deal from [safestore.co.uk](http://www.safestore.co.uk/) who got me 16sq feet of storage for just under £30 a month so before this month is over I will have managed to get a fair bit of rarely used stuff out of my apartment.\n\nI am also preparing some items I no longer need for sale on eBay, hopefully the extra money this will bag me will be enough to buy me my shelves with a bit left over to save up for a new desk.\n\n## Mind\n\nEmily Bell is coming along nicely, I have just passed the 10k word threshold and I believe that if I persevere I can get the first draft finished within 5-6 weeks. I have also just started a group on facebook for like-minded locals who wish to read their work to a group and hear the work of others to meet up weekly. This is to fill the void that will be left behind once the writing course has finished but mainly to provide us with a bit of a 'deadline' feel to our writing so we are not tempted to slack off. Three members of my course (myself included) all have stories that I would very much like to see brought to conclusion and I believe this group will be a big help in achieving that.\n\nIn terms of attending another class after my creative writing one has finished, I will probably not do this for a while. The martial arts lessons are quite expensive and I'm not sure I can really afford another class on top of it, plus there is still the chance that the advanced creative writing course will go ahead and I'd like to keep myself free for that.\n\n \n\nActually now, I've written it down, I'm made quite good progress, I'm impressed with myself!",

                "body": "There are a lot of posts on the Internet at the moment about the Mayan prophecies and all that rubbish, I have no doubt that life will go on after 2012 and I want it to be better than it currently is.\n\n\nFor most of my adult life I have been into the idea of self improvement and as a result I have acquired a great many skills over the years. However since becoming single for the first time in my adult life in mid-2010 I decided to switch my self improvement focus from learning fun new skills to loftier goals with a view to making some real changes to my life, I have already made some good progress with these changes but this year I am going to go all out into achieving as many of my goals on the list below as I possibly can.\n\nI have divided the list into categories as each category focuses on a different area of my life:\n\n## Health\n\nSelf explanatory really, my goal here is to improve the condition of my body. As pretty much every one of my friends tell me, I am very unhealthy and need to do something about it. I am currently 220lbs which is considerably lighter than this time last year but still far from light enough. Plus I want to tone up a little and increase my general fitness.\n\n### Goals for this category:\n\n#### Reach target weight of 155lbs\n\nAs I mentioned above, I am quite overweight, whilst I&apos;m not massive (although I have been there) I am determined to make this year the year I _really_ make a change in my life so instead of just getting to a point where I don&apos;t look like crap, I want to get fit. The main way I'm doing it is through improving my diet, I've been using [My Fitness Pal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com) for a while now which has contributed to nearly all the progress I've made so far. Getting down to my ideal body weight is only step one though.\n\n#### Attend martial arts classes\n\nBecoming fighting fit is step two. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m never going to be an exercise addict, ever. I don&apos;t really enjoy it enough. I attended my first kickboxing class tonight and whilst it was a lot of fun, it was still work. Plus I have no desire to be ripped, I don&apos;t need a six-pack or biceps that could punch through a bus. I&apos;d just like to look better than I do now and live longer than I will if I continue as I am.\n\n## Environment\n\nBy &apos;environment&apos; I don&apos;t mean the world and it&apos;s plethora of issues (although they are included). The aim of these goals is to improve my immediate environment, IE: My Apartment.\n\n### **Goals for this category:**\n\n#### Set up a sustainable recycling system\n\nI _do_ currently have a recycling system, this is it:\n\n![A photo of my recycling system with 2 bins and a carrier bag.](https://res.cloudinary.com/foxleigh/image/upload/v1643717294/Trinity_One_Recycling_system_b1ff0fde73.jpg)\n\nWhilst I'm sure this is a better effort than what quite a lot of people manage, it suffers from one fatal flaw; it is disorganised, when things are not perfectly organised, I fail at them. So my goal is to really organise my recycling system so it still fits into the same space but works around me. My apartments bin store does not have any option for separating paper, metal and plastics but it does have a compost bin so I also want to start collecting waste to be composted.\n\n#### Get a hidden litter tray for puddles (My Cat)\n\nThis is Puddles, she is - by far - my favourite thing in my life:\n\n![A photo of my black cat, puddles peeking over my laptop screen.](https://res.cloudinary.com/foxleigh/image/upload/v1643717294/Puddles_e8bd402486.jpg)\n\nUnfortunately, she comes with one big downside, she has a digestive system, which means I have to have a litter tray, now there are two flaws to having a litter tray in an apartment:\n\n1. There is nowhere to put it where it isn't in the way and unsightly.\n2. The smell.\n\nNumber two can only be fixed by being a better cat owner and scooping more often than I do (which I plan to do) however number one is really starting to grind my gears, so I need to find a cheap and straightforward way to hide my litter tray but still make it easily accessible to my fluffy little flatmate.\n\n#### Buy some plants\n\nNo brainer really, plants look nice, plants smell nice. I want both of those qualities present in my flat. I read [this](http://www.plant-care.com/apartment-plants-5-easy-care-houseplants-for-a-touch-of-nature.html) [article](http://www.plant-care.com/apartment-plants-5-easy-care-houseplants-for-a-touch-of-nature.html) last summer which gave me some good ideas. Still not quite gotten around to it yet though.\n\n#### Buy new shelves\n\nI love books and I love movies, whilst my movie collection is gradually going digital, I still have a great deal of DVD&apos;s and even more books. My book cases have not only run out of room but have even started to sag, lean and warp. New ones seem to be quite expensive if you want anything decent so that may require some saving.\n\n#### Find a way to make more space\n\nMy apartment is far from a penthouse but considering what I pay for it, it&apos;s a pretty good size, I&apos;ve looked at apartments which were tiny compared to mine and cost the same (or more in some cases), however I have a lot of stuff and I seem to need it all, somehow I need to find a way to make some more space. Particularly because:\n\n#### I want a new desk\n\nThis is my desk at the moment:\n\n![A picture of my desk with my computer and Puddles, my black cat on it.](https://res.cloudinary.com/foxleigh/image/upload/v1643717294/My_Desk_at_Trinity_One_14cacd1350.jpg)\n\nThis was the desk I had before I moved here :\n\n![A photo of my old corner desk with multiple monitors ](https://res.cloudinary.com/foxleigh/image/upload/v1643717294/Sacred_Gate_Desk_1c76faa736.jpg)\n\nIn order to get this apartment I had to get rid of my desk and sell two of my monitors and my PC speakers. As a novel writer, blogger, PC gamer and web developer it was very frustrating going from three monitors to one and I seriously over estimated my ability to cope with that and to work on a desk the size of a chopping board.\n\n## Mind\n\nI&apos;m quite a clever guy (if I do say so myself), this is largely due to the years of learning new things and absorbing information wherever possible. My goal is to continue on this path and increase my educational input as much as possible.\n\n### **Goals for this category:**\n\n#### Attend at least two college courses\n\nThis one is pretty much in the bag to be honest, I&apos;ve already started an intermedia [creative writing course](/scribblings/creative-writing-course/) and when this finishes, I plan to do the advanced course as well. I may even fit a third course in if I have the time.\n\n#### Read one book per week\n\nI actually read quite a lot, however I&apos;ve read a few challenging books lately (one of which took me three months to finish - and by finish I mean say &apos;sod this&apos; and put it back on my shelf), I&apos;m currently reading two books, &apos;[Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha&apos;](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0749397357/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=filteredreali-21&link_code=as3&camp=2506&creative=9298&creativeASIN=0749397357) by Roddy Doyle and &apos;[The Hound of the Baskervilles](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/014043786X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=filteredreali-21&link_code=as3&camp=2506&creative=9298&creativeASIN=014043786X)&apos; by Arther Conan Doyle. I&apos;m finding the former interminably dull (actually that&apos;s a lie, there were a few parts which were moderately enjoyable) but I am determined to finish it, however I find myself reaching for Sherlock much more often. Once Paddy Clarke is finished, I&apos;m going to commit myself to reading one book a week. To do this I&apos;ll stick with lighter books, if I want to read Plato again, I&apos;ll do it alongside another, much more enjoyable book.\n\n#### Finish either Emily Bell, The Ghost of you or preferably; both.\n\nI&apos;m currently writing two novels (titles above). The latter I have just started this week and the former I&apos;ve been writing for about four months. I&apos;ve made a lot of progress on Emily Bell but not nearly as much as I should have done. I am going to start by committing to writing at least 30 minutes a day and try to get in at least an hour. If I can write 1000 words a day, I will be happy with that.\n\n#### Learn to Drive\n\nIt is my great shame that at thirty years old, I still cannot drive. This year will be the year I finally pass my test. Of course, living in the middle of Leeds city centre, I&apos;ll probably not find a use for a car for a while but at least I&apos;ll have the skill when I need it.\n\n**Begin learning an instrument**\n\nLast year a couple of friends of mine attempted to teach me how to play the guitar, I learned a few bars of &apos;Smoke on the water&apos; and then stopped. I have since acquired an electric keyboard as well as an electric guitar so I am determined to learn how to play at least one of those, preferably the keyboard so I can piss my sister off who has been practising for years.\n\n## GO, GO, GO\n\nI will be keeping you all up to date on these goals, not only telling you how I&apos;m doing but also what I&apos;ve done, so if any of you decide to attempt similar endeavours, you will have some help. At the end of the year I&apos;ll go through this list again and see how I measured up.\n\nIf anyone has any (helpful) suggestions, please feel free to leave a comment :)\n\nWish me luck!",

I didn&apos;t know this at the time but 2014 was about to be one of the worst years of my life for health.\n\n\nI lived in the middle of nowhere, there were no gyms nearby (not even on a direct bus route) and Portsmouth has a terrible transport infrastructure. My life was incredibly sedentary and as I couldn&apos;t even get to a decent quality market regularly, my diet also suffered. On top of that, 2014 was a highly stressful year for me and although I'm very good at not showing signs of stress, one of the biggest signs that I am not as calm as I could me is that I stop taking care of myself. Out were the trips to the gym, out were the lighter lunches and regular intake of water and in were the daily fry-ups, the sausage roll snacks and increased consumption of fizzy drinks (a habit which I'd managed to almost kick only 18 months earlier).\n\nToday I live in London, there are fantastic markets on my doorstep, the transport links are excellent and there is a great culture of walking here, which I have already begun to embrace. My life is a hell of a lot less stressful and is a great deal more enjoyable than the life I had in Pompey. What&apos;s more, there is a gym less than 5 minutes walk from my front door.\n\nI joined today and one of the first things I did when I went was to step on the scales &emdash; something which I hadn&apos;t done for a good 8-9 months &emdash; I was mortified to see the scales at 250lb (17.8st), that was over 20lbs (1.4st) than the 228lb (16.2st) I weighed back then.\n\nSomething has to be done. I&apos;m 33 years old now and my body isn&apos;t going to tolerate this abuse for much longer.\n\n> **This is my formal declaration that I am going to sort this out. I have formulated a plan, which I believe I can stick to.**\n\n## I will restart the 5:2 diet:\n\nA few years ago I started this diet and found fantastic results with it, I managed to maintain it for almost 6 months before falling off the wagon.  It was actually a lot easier than I expected it to be and after about 3-4 weeks, I managed to get through a fast day with relative ease. However I broke the chain once or twice and when I found myself ill with Swine Flu, I spent weeks feeling like I had no will, whatsoever and ended up going so far off track that I found it too hard to get back on.\n\n## I will go to the gym for at least one hour every weekday:\n\nI&apos;ve formulated a workout routine, which I believe I can stick to:\n\n- 45 mins on the cross trainer\n- 3 x 10 reps on the bicep machine\n- 3 x 10 reps on the leg extension machine\n- 3 x 10 reps on the lat machine\n- 3 x 10 reps on the calf extension machine\n- 3 x 10 reps on the back extension machine\n- 10 mins on the rowing machine\n- 10 mins on the exercise bike\n\nThe cross trainer will be the start of my workout each day and then I will do a combination of each of the other workouts, varying them throughout the week. Eventually I hope to increase the cross trainer to a full hour and up the reps on the machines to 15-20.\n\n## Embrace a healthier diet:\n\nIt&apos;s no secret to anyone who knows me that I like my food. Hell, you only need to look at me to see that. Unfortunately, my tastes have always veered towards high-fat and carb-heavy foods in rather large portions. In fact, I&apos;m more likely to eat a take-away than cook a proper meal at home.\n\nMy diet has improved over the years but as I get older, this is starting to become too little, too late. Luckily for me, my wonderful girlfriend, Colette is a big fan of healthy food and over the last few years has slowly started to open my palate up to it too, whilst I&apos;d still much rather have a massive curry with plenty of rice, chips and naan bread. I&apos;ll also not say no to an aubergine pasta salad, or a chilli made with a lot of spinach and kale.\n\n2015 is going to be the year I stop turning my nose up at my girlfriends diet and really try to appreciate the health benefits it gives me, provided it still tastes good, of course :)\n\nI also need to drink a lot more water, I was really good at this a few years ago but once again, lifestyle and apathy moved me away from water and towards sugary drinks. I actually really like drinking a lot of water, I really feel its benefits when I am well hydrated so I am keen to get this one underway immediately.\n\n## Walk more:\n\nThe last step is hopefully going to take care of itself by virtue of living in London and that is to spend more time walking. I will get off a tube stop early and if I can, I will walk around central London, rather than taking public transport.\n\n## My Goals:\n\n### Reach 210lb (15st) by 1st July 2015.\n\nThis will mean I need to consistently lose 2lb a week, it will be a stretch but I believe that I can achieve this. Ideally I&apos;d like to reach 200lb (14.2st), however this is perhaps slightly less realistic\n\n### Reach 160lb (11.4st) by my 34th Birthday (2nd December).\n\nAgain this assumes a consistent weight loss of 2lb a week, if I can achieve this then I will be at the upper end of my ideal weight for my height. Anything I manage to lose after that will just be bonus weight. I&apos;d gladly stay at that weight for the rest of my life.\n\nI&apos;ve tried this before and failed spectacularly but it really is starting to feel like this is something that I NEED to do in order to live a healthy and happy life. I really do hope I can do it this year.\n\nWish me luck!",

Hi Mum!) will know that my weight is something I have been battling with for many years and at one point, I even started a YouTube challenge where I did a juice fast for a while.\n\n2016 was a pretty landmark year for my health, I discovered that I loved the outdoors and more importantly, I discovered that my life didn&apos;t end or even change much at all once I gave up fizzy drinks. In the past I&apos;ve managed to cut down on my sugar intake by limiting myself to only having it at the weekends but I&apos;ve never managed to give up an entire section of sugary treats and anyone who knows me, knows that fizzy drinks were like crack to me. I&apos;ve now not had a single fizzy drink since October last year (actually, that&apos;s a lie, I drank a mouthful of coke about 2 weeks ago to see if I thought it would taste different &emdash; it did, far too sweet for me now!).\n\nMy body has started to respond to this and my weight is slowly coming down, at this moment I am around 245lbs (last August I was 256lbs!). I&apos;m hoping that my new, healthier lifestyle will mean that I don&apos;t have to worry about yo-yoing (something that happens to me on a pretty much annual basis) but, just to make sure that I stay on a downward trajectory. I&apos;m going to start doing some more exercise, I&apos;ll be joining my local archery club when they re-open in a few months, I&apos;m going to start hiking more regularly (which I love doing anyway so that shouldn&apos;t be too hard and I am looking for a parkour class that is convenient for me to get to. If I can convince my fiancée to come with me, I also plan to start an MMA class soon).\n\n## 2 Save £15k\n\nThe year hasn&apos;t gotten to a great start for this one, I&apos;m not going to lie. Thanks to an unplanned move and a hefty tax bill, my finances are pretty low at the moment, however thanks to YNAB and a bit of will-power, I am pretty sure I can bounce back by the start of March. Once this happens I plan to open an investment portfolio and work out some ways to add extra income streams to my balance sheet. I already have some cash savings (Thanks Dad!) but I&apos;m not including that in my goal as that would be cheating.\n\n \n\n## 3 Buy a house\n\nRealistically, this ain&apos;t gonna happen this year. There is no way we&apos;re going to get a deposit together, plus as I mentioned earlier, we&apos;ve just moved so we&apos;ve got a 1 year rental contract anyway. However it&apos;s still definitely a goal and you never know, perhaps I&apos;ll get a fantastic book deal, perhaps I&apos;ll find some buried treasure or maybe one of my income stream ideas pays of big time.\n\nMaybe we&apos;ll just carry on obsessively looking at RightMove and sighing for a bit longer.\n\n## 4 Get married\n\nFour years ago I hit the jackpot when one of my incredibly attractive, intelligent and lovely friends told me she had feelings for me, last week, I asked her to marry me, so now we&apos;ve got a wedding to arrange!\n\nAgain, this isn&apos;t gonna happen this year as we&apos;ve got a lot to plan and a lot to save up for, however we still need to do the planning and the saving so this is a valid goal.\n\n## 5 Publish a book\n\nI&apos;m currently writing two books, one is a novel that I&apos;ve been working on for years (very slowly) and one is a political non-fiction book which I&apos;ve actually finished and am now working on re-drafting.\n\nPretty soon I suspect it will be at a state where I can start trying to get it published. As I&apos;ve never done this before, I have no idea how successful I&apos;ll be and from what I&apos;ve heard, this process is more frustrating and time-consuming than actually writing the damn book, so wish me luck!\n\nAt the end of the year, I&apos;ll make another post to review these goals and we&apos;ll see how I&apos;ve done!",

                "body": "I had a lot of goals last year, how many did I acheive?\n\n## 1) Reach 200lbs - FAILED\n\nNope, not even close. I made some serious headway into improving my health though, I took part in 100 healthy days, which didn't result in a huge amount of weight loss but it did put me in a position where I got out of the habit of eating processed food and I massively cut down my sugar intake.\n\nAll-in-all, the year ended with me weighing 243lbs, which is only 2lb lighter than when I started.\n\n## 2) Save £15k - SUCCESS!\n\nI actually managed to do this one, throughout almost all of 2017 I had a single contract and as I worked from home, I managed to save a huge amount of money, truth be told, this was only a technical success, I had to pay myself a higher amount each month and as soon as I hit my target I had to spend it as we had decided that we were going to make goal 3 a reality.\n\n## 3) Buy a house - SUCCESS\n\nWhich we did!\n\nRather unbelievably, this is our home!\n\n![A Photograph of the front of my house](images/home-1024x702.png)\n\nOriginally we had decided that we were going to wait a few years before buying, however, a number of factors in 2016 and 2017 came together and made us decide to move that timeline forward. The short version is that we had grown tired of renting, we desperately wanted the security of knowing that we owned the roof over our heads and we could do whatever we wanted with it.\n\nIt wasn't easy as we both had to basically save all of our money for most of the year and even then we needed to borrow quite a bit from our families but in October we finally exchanged contracts on our first home together.\n\n## 4) Get married - SUCCESS!\n\nWithin about a week of writing my 2017 goals, Colette and I came to the conclusion that neither of us were that interested in the wedding, we were interested in the marriage. So we decided that rather than spend a year being engaged and putting all of our money into a wedding, we'd instead get married immediately and basically turn it into an intimate gathering.\n\n![All of the guests at our wedding](images/17835052_10154205871885194_9023070405855450222_o-1024x457.jpg)\n\nIt couldn't have gone better, our wedding was tiny (only 11 people including us - as you can see above) but it was incredibly intimate and was such a beautiful day. Plus thanks to the money we saved, we were able to buy our house instead which was the best wedding gift to ourselves we could have managed!\n\nYou can read more about it [here](/meandering-insanity/holy-crap-im-married/)\n\n## 5) Publish a book - SUCCESS!\n\nI did this one too! I won't go more into this, as I have already [written an article about it](/scribblings/lets-kill-capitalism/)\n\n \n\nAll in all, that was probably the best year of my life, 2018 has a hard act to follow and now I've achieved so much, I have to come up with a whole new site of goals!",

                "body": "This year has a hard act to follow, in 2017 I smashed all but one of my goals and they were not small goals (Get married, Save 15k, Buy a house, publish a book).\n\nI still have goals left to achieve though so let's get them down!\n\n\n## 1) Reach 200lbs\n\nOne of these days I'm actually going to achieve this one, however this year I feel like I stand a fighting chance. Some of my worser demons have been exised now (I used to crave bad food a lot, especially if I was tired/stressed/grumpy/awake, now I very rarely do) and I've developed some pretty decent habits (I walk a lot more these days and although I'm definitely not a vegetarian, my diet is a lot less meat-based and a lot more plant-based than it used to be).\n\nI'm still sceptical that I can lose 40lbs in the space of one year without doing something extreme but hey, it wouldn't be a year goal if it was easy.\n\n## 2) Finish my novel\n\nLast year I published a book that I'd spent several years writing, as great as an achievement as that was, it was a non-fiction book and took attention away from my novel writing. Emily Bell has been on my laptop in (half of a) draft format for at [least 6 years](/mind-body-and-soul/2012-not-the-end-the-beginning/).\n\nEven if I don't send it to a publisher this year, I'd still be very happy if I could at least finish the first and second drafts.\n\n## 3) Get a bath\n\nDon't worry, my goal for 2018 isn't 'have a bath' its 'get a bath', as much as I love our new house, it only has showers, however, the main bathroom is right next to the guest room which itself is next to a room so small that it's practically useless apart from storing crap. So we plan to have builders in to move some walls around and extend our bathroom so it's big enough to put a bathtub in there as both of us sorely miss having a nice soak in the tub. I imagine this will be quite expensive though and we're still recovering financially from last year so again, this one is a tall order.\n\n## 4) Achieve 100% remote work\n\nAs I write this, I'm having to do a long commute (3 hours on a good day, up to 4 hours on an average day) and it's driving me mental. Prior to this, I had a contract which was 70% remote for over a year and prior to that, I had one that was 90% remote.\n\nDue to the nature of my job and the fact that I don't like going into London, I want to make it my goal this year that I exclusively take 100% remote contracts (barring the odd day here and there where I go in for a meeting or something).\n\nIdeally, I'd do this via freelancing (I do as many projects as I can want for as many clients as I like in my own time at my own pace for an hourly/daily/fixed rate) but as it's harder to get freelance roles, contracting (I have a single client and I work for them for set hours on a single project) is much more likely.\n\nEither way is fine though, so long as I don't have to leave my house :)\n\n## 5) Get a puppy and a kitten.\n\nLast year, we lost Ember, a few years before that, we lost Puddles, we now are completely petless and it sucks big time.\n\nWe plan to get a kitten as soon as one of us can be at home for a month so that it's not alone during its formative weeks and if I do manage to achieve goal 4 and I can be at home all the time, we're also going to get a puppy. The latter is particularly exciting to me as I've never had a dog before.\n\nWell, that's it. I'll check back in a year and we'll see how I did!",

That made 2018 a tough act to follow. However I did surprisingly well on my goals. Here's how I did.\n\n\n## 1) Reach 200lbs: Failed\n\nOK I didn't achive this one. Ah well, maybe next year.\n\n## 2) Finish my novel: Failed\n\nNope! I didn't even get chance to get started, 2018 year was incredibly busy and frankly, I just couldn't prioritise it highly enough. \n\n## 3) Get a bath: Failed\n\nI still don't have a bath, however I've made major headway into getting one, we now know what bath we want, we have designed our new bathroom (at least in our heads), we've had the preliminary work that was needed to be done, done and we've found a great plumber. So it's pretty likely that 2019 will be the year of the bath.\n\n## 4) Achieve 100% remote work: Success!\n\nI am now as close to 100% remote work as you can reasonably expect to be in my industry, I now only go in the office when there is a meeting or event which I cannot easily attend via video chat. This usually results in me only having to spend about 4-5 hours there every other week. Which is just find and dandy for me as I've got a new home office and I love it so much, I never want to leave it. (article coming soon)\n\n## 5) Get a puppy and a kitten: Sort of success\n\nTECHNICALLY this is a fail as the goal specified both a puppy and A kitten. We didn't manage the puppy but we now have not one but TWO cats! They are not kittens anymore as we got them right at the tail end of their kitten-hood and have now had them for about 6 months but they are still very much kitten-like and are lovely cats.\n\nThey are called Midnight and Shadow (we didn't name them, we got them from a rescue centre with those names - we love them though so we kept them) If you want to know more about them then they are already showbiz enough to have their own instagram profile. [Check them out here](https://www.instagram.com/midnight_and_shadow_cats/).\n\nHere is a sneak peek: \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BpkbNiulHcE/\n\n\nSo yeah, not quite as amazing as 2017 but it was never going to be but it was still a great year in it's own right and as my life trajectory only seems to go up lately, I'm looking forward to seeing what 2019 will bring!",

                "body": "Every year, I like to set myself a public list of goals that I then do my best to acheive. Some years it works, some years it doesn't, most years I manage to make this list before nearly a quarter of it is already in the past, this was not one of those years.\n\n\n## 1 Reach 200lbs\n\nEvery year I've added this goal and every year I'm sure it will be the year I acheive it. However this year stands a fighting chance as at the end of last year, I made one major change which I've - so far - managed to stick to.\n\nI actually exercise now!\n\nAs we do not currently have a bath in our house (see Goal #3) we decided to join a local gym which has a spa pool, for me, the reason to join the gym was so I had a place I could soak my - usually - aching body body on a night, I never really had much of an intention to do any working out and fully intended to bin the gym membership as soon as our bathroom was done.\n\nHowever, connected to the spa pool was an actual pool. So - on the odd occasion when I felt I could be bothered - I jumped in the pool and had a paddle about. Then after a few weeks, I started to swim properly in it. Then I bought some goggles and a nose clip and started swimming at least 10 lengths every time I went to the gym. \n\nFast forward a few months and now the spa-pool is where I go to soak my incredibly aching muscles after I've had a proper swim workout. I've started doing HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) swimming, which means I only actually swim for 15 minutes but I go hell-for-leather when I do it. Amazingly, I can already feel a huge difference in my body. I feel stronger, less achy and I have definitly got some muscle now! \n\nI'm still very overweight and have a long way to go before I will be 200lbs but it's actually feasible that this will happen before 2020!\n\n## 2 Learn to drive\n\nI haven't listed this goal in [7 years](/mind-body-and-soul/2012-not-the-end-the-beginning) because even though it kinda bothered me that I couldn't drive, I have - until recently - always live in an area where driving didn't really matter. Going from Leeds city centre (everything I wanted was on my doorstep), to Portsmouth (a pretty compact city so easy to get around on foot/bike/bus), to London (It's London, I just took the tube everywhere). However in 2016, we left city life behind us and moved to - what I thought was - the country, at first I didn't really mind, I spent most of my time either working from home or going into London, I didn't really need a car and the times I did, Colette could drive me.\n\nThen we bought our house and moved to the *proper* countryside, it was only then that I realised that the area we lived in before was bascially a more rural extension of London, I had high-speed internet, great transport links everywhere and if I needed a car during the day I still had Uber.\n\nNow I live in a town 4 miles away from the nearest city (Guildford) and we're on the outskirts, behind our house is open countryside which goes on for miles and the internet here is so slow that it takes me 22 hours to upload a blog post (ok that's an exaggeration, it's more like 21 hours and 50 minutes). \n\nThe problem is that I love it here, it's peaceful and relaxing, it smells amazing and I have a balcony which gives me panoramic views of the incredible [Surrey Hills](https://www.surreyhills.org/) instead of some fat dude having a topless BBQ on his own balcony (alone).\n\nSo I can't go back, I'm countrified now and that means I need to be able to get around, there isn't even a realible taxi company here, let alone Uber and the buses are pretty terrible so there is nothing for it. I have to be able to drive.\n\nI'm almost certainly going to succeed at this one (famous last words), I actually started my lessons quite a while ago and I even have my driving test booked so I'm pretty sure we'll be seeing a big ol' 'success' label on the 'how did I do' post in 2020.\n\n## 3 Get my bathroom done\n\nI still don't have a bath in my house, Colette and I decided that we were not going to settle for any old bath, we're going to get a freestanding copper bath, we've already chosen the one we want and we've even had some preliminary works carried out ready for our bathroom remodel.\n\nYup, I said 'remodel', we're not just having a bath installed now, we've decided to basically demolish everything that the previous owners did in there and rebuild it from scratch. How will it go? Find out next year!\n\n## 4 Get my office sorted.\n\nI've been a remote worker for about 5 years now and last year I acheived the coveted goal of 100% remote work (or near as dammit). I've had some pretty ropey home offices in the past but in this house, I've struck gold. However it's not perfect. I would love to have a properly kitted out home office with everything I may need in it.\n\nAgain this one is pretty much a foregone conclusion, I've got practically everything I need now to achieve this goal, I just need the time to put it all together which I hope to do within the next month.\n\n## 5 Build that wall\n\nNo, not THAT wall. Our house is lovely but we are not loaded and couldn't afford a big beautiful house without making some fairly big compromises, so our compromise was that we bought a house next to a busy road. This turned out to be more of a compromise than I anticipated as the noise can occasionally drive me crazy. \n\nWe have two options to alleviate this, get triple glazing installed at the front of the house (which we might do anyway but that's boring) or build a two-metre high wall around the perimiter.\n\nThe latter is a lot more preferable to me as a) it blocks people out of my world a bit more - always a bonus, b) It stops fuckwits from throwing litter in our drive way and most importantly c) having a big wall around your house is baddass.\n\nThis goal might not happen this year as although Col has accepted that it's going to happen, she's not really sold on it as a priority. I've got a much better chance at selling her on the triple glazing as that's also more energy efficient. However we shall see.\n\nTune in next year to find out how I did!",

                "body": "Look at me! I'm doing my how did I do post already and it's only the 2nd of January! That must mean that 2020 is the year I finally start acting like a grown-up, right?\n\n\n## 1) Reach 200lbs: MEGA FAIL!!\n\nI weighed myself when I got up this morning on the off chance that I now weight 200lbs even though I can't fit into last summers t-shirts anymore. No such luck, I currently weigh 258.6lbs which is right up there at the fattest I've ever been (I think my record is somewhere around the 265lb mark.) Gonna rethink this goal for this year, I still want to lose weight but trying to lose 40+ lbs in a year clearly isn't an acheivable goal for me.\n\n## 2) Learn to drive: PASSED!\n\nAmazingly, I passed this one, I took my test in April and passed first time. I got my first car in May and I'm utterly in love!\n\n![Mini!](./images/blue-midget.jpg)\n\nI want to do my pass-plus this year so I can get my insurance down, I'm a pretty decent driver (although I've got a habit of over-revving the engine), so I think I'll be able to get that done fairly easily.\n\n## 3) Get my bathroom done: FAILED\n\nOur finances took a hit this year as we've made a strong effort to move ourselves out of the debt that buying our house got us into. So we didn't get the money together to get the bathroom done, plus we're indecisive so we kept changing our minds about 'the plan'. We *think* we know what we want now though so hopefully it's gonna happen in 2020.\n\n## 4) Get my office sorted: SUCCESS!!\n\nIn 2018 I managed to get to a point where I was working remotely close to 100% of the time (I had to go in once a fortnight). However in 2019, that contract fell-through and I ended up back in a contract which was 60% remote work so my office project stopped being quite so high a priority. Then, just as the year got close to ending, I managed to land an even better contract than last years which actually is 100% remote work, I never have to go into the office as we're a distributed team and there is no office to go into!\n\nSo I put my office back on the priority list, I had most of what I needed to get it done and the gap between projects was *just* enough time to do the work.\n\nHere is the 'before' shot:\n\n![My office, pre-upgrade](./images/before.jpg)\n\nand here is the glorious 'after' shot:\n\n![My office, post-upgrade](./images/after.jpg)\n\nI need to mount my pictures again and I still have a few more upgrades to make. I want to mount my server monitor to the shelves to the left of my desk and put some LED lighting in the built-in shelving but all-in-all. I'm incredibly happy with the result. I might even do a post about it at some point.\n\n## 5) Build that wall: FAILED\n\nSame as the bathroom plan, we just didn't end up having the budget for it. Truth be told, we probably could have stretched to this one but we needed a new boiler and spent the money on that, plus we had the boiler relocated to a different part of the house to allow for a pantry and to make way for the eventual bathroom upgrade. Maybe this year.\n\nKeep an eye out for my 2020 goals, coming in the next few days :)",

                "body": "It's not just a new year, it's a new decade, welcome to the roaring 20's! Let's set some goals, shall we?\n\nSo this is the decade where I'll hit 40 and I'm starting to feel my age, I realised the last few months that my health trajectory isn't sustainable anymore as I'm too old to just shrug it off. With that in mine, most of my goals this year are about changing that trajectory.\n\n\n## 1) Maintain a sustainable weight loss\n\nEvery year I've had a target weight in mind and every year, I've failed. Instead of setting myself a tough goal to reach, instead I want to just keep myself on a path to a healthy weight throughout the year. So forget targets, instead I just want to lose weight consistently throughout the year until I eventually feel like I'm at a weight I can be happy with.\n\nObviously to keep it off, it needs to be sustainable so no crash diets or attempts to 'shed the pounds', if I can just make sure I make a net loss week-by-week, I'll be happy, even if it's only a fraction of a pound.\n\n\n## 2) Adopt a better attitude to food\n\nAs Colette lamented to me on New Years Day when I begged her to let us go out for a Chinese to make up for a dull new years eve, both of us have a the link between 'food' and 'fun'. That's an unhealthy link, plus it made me realise that I don't really have a link between 'food' and 'sustainance' which is probably a root cause of my unhealthy eating pattern.\n\nIn my mind, eating 'naughty' food, helps me to feel happy and relaxed on stressful days but in fact, the opposite is more likely to be true.\n\nThis is going to be a tough one as it's a link that formed over many decades and could take a long time to break. However, I think that it's an important one, food is sustainance, not entertainment.\n\n## 3) I need to move more\n\nOK so I'm of the school of thought that weight loss comes from diet and not exercise, so I've always let myself slack a bit when it comes to getting off my arse. However, this last year, I've started to feel a bit 'feeble', standing up is usually accompanied by a grunt and I've got enoguh stamina to run the tap but that's about it as far as running goes.\n\nThis one is about fitness, about heart health and about not dropping dead before my time.\n\nI managed to get a start on this last year as I discovered I really enjoy swimming but as is often the pattern with me, I eventually let it lapse and then just quit. \n\nSo first steps this year is to rejoin the gym and get back to swimming, luckily, I'm self-employed so I can easily go at the quiet times, which will be a lot easier to motivate myself to do.\n\nAs I'm at the gym, it makes sense for me to do some weight training as well, I'm going to aim to start off with going to the gym 3 times a week.\n\nCol and I also recently set up a VR room in our house, so my plan is to play a few intense VR games on the days I don't go to the gym.\n\nI'll consider my goal successful if I manage to hit at least 30 mins of exercise a day. I'll consider my goal smashed if I can [close all three rings on my Apple watch](https://www.apple.com/uk/watch/close-your-rings/) every single day.\n\nRight, that's the health stuff done.\n\n## 4) Get my finances in order\n\nA few years ago, Colette and I [bought a house](/mind-body-and-soul/2017-goals-how-did-i-do/) and since then, we've both been skint, in fact we've been in debt and, whilst that's improved a lot, it's still true as of today.\n\nSo, my goal for this year is to eliminate my non-essential debt and build up a savings pool. I can't do much about my student loans, my car loan or my mortgage but I've got credit card debt and a few other loan agreements which are pretty small and should be achievable debt goals for the year.\n\nI'll consider this one done if my credit card is clean and I only have the loans above left by the 1st of Jan next year, I'll consider it smashed if my savings and investment pots also have a healthy balance.\n\n## 5) Get at least one of the projects in the house sorted\n\nLast year I specifically said I wanted to get our bathroom renovated but that didn't happen. However Colette and I both managed to get our offices done, that's mainly because we didn't have to deal with 'decoration discussions' for our own rooms and the budget for those rooms was a LOT smaller than the others but at least they are out of the way now.\n\nI'll consider this goal complete if one of the following house projects is complete:\n\n- The perimiter wall\n- The bathroom\n- The living room\n- The stairwell\n- The kitchen\n- The garden\n\nI'll consider it smashed if more than one of those is done, I'll do a goddamn cartwheel if they are all done as it means that somehow we became rich during 2020.\n\n## 6) Finish the first draft of Emily Bell\n\nNew readers to my blog (Do I have any readers yet?) may not know this but I used to be quite a keen novel writer, or should I say 'aspiring' novel writer as I've yet to finish one. A novel I've been working on for [Many years](/scribblings/cover-design-for-emily-bell/) is a story called 'The bleeding heart of Emily Bell'. I've literally been working on this for a decade at this point but the main reason I've yet to finish the first draft is because I just don't make the time to write anymore.\n\nNow I'm only working four days per week, I want to use my extra day off as a 'doing' day. Now unfortunately I have a list of personal projects longer than my arm, so part of my job this year will be to whittle down that list and remove some of the less useful projects from my list and also get my priorities in order, I know that my top priority this year will be to finish the first draft of my novel so I will try to make a lot of time for that.\n\n--- \n\nSo, those are my 6 goals for the year, tune in next year to see how I did!",

                "body": "Wow. 2020 was one hell of a year, right?!\n\n\nI think we can all agree that 2020 wasn't the year we were expecting. Surprisingly, I managed to achieve a lot this year, however many of those achievements were not the ones I was targeting here. So I'm going to add a section at the end about what I DID acheive, for those who are interested :)\n\n## 1) Maintain a sustainable weight loss: Failed\n\nI actually started doing really well on this one, even when lockdown started I seemed to have a good pattern of sustainable loss, it wasn't much, maybe 1/2 lb a week but over time that would have made a big difference but, like with a lot of other poeople these year, as the pandemic wore on, my self-control waned and before long I was back to scarfing chocolates, drinking more fizzy drinks than I should (although even then only a few per week) and eating WAY more takeaway food than is sensible to do so.\n\nI ended the year, slightly more overweight than I started (literally less than 1lb though so I don't really consider that as being too bad, all things considered)\n\n## 2) Adopt a better attitude to food: Semi-Success\n\nThis one is a stretch to call it a success, in fact, had I written this article in December I'd probably have called it a full-on fail. However, once the New Years resolutions started, I found that I was easily able to find food options which were both delicious and healthy, which, last January, I really struggled to do. In fact, I've not eaten meat since New Years Eve and although I'm definitely missing it a bit, it's not been challenging at all to find enjoyable pescatarian meals. In fact, the majority of our meals have been full-on vegetarian. \n\nI can't bring myself to call it a success, however as the wiring in my brain still equates food with entertainment and not sustainance. Until that has gone, it's definitely not a success.\n\n## 3) I need to move more: Fail with a dash of success\n\nI've probably never moved less in my life for the majority of this year. However in October, I started to build a chicken run on my allotment, which caused me to do a lot of heavy lifting and to be on my feet, moving around for 4-6 hours a day (weather permitting), so whilst I didn't acheive this goal in the way I expected, I kind of got there in the last few months.\n\n## 4) Get my finances in order: Fail\n\nMy finances are definitely better, I have eliminated my car loan and even paid off a huge amount of credit card debt, however it's still there and I still spend most of the month in my overdraft. So this is definitely not a success\n\n\n## 5) Get at least one of the projects in the house sorted: Success!\n\nFinally, we have a success! The bathroom is now done, the living room and kitchen have been hugely improved and the Garden is making progress.\n\nWe realised that we were out of our depth when it came to sorting the house out, so we have hired an architect to help us sort it out in phases, so the bathroom may end up getting redone again in the next year or two, but we now have a bathtub, which is a huge deal for me.\n\n## 6) Finish the first draft of Emily Bell: Fail\n\nI don't think I wrote a single word. \n\n## Bonus round: What DID I actually achieve?\n\nSo, lots of fails above. However I consider 2020 to be a big success for me as I managed to cross two things off my life-goals list:\n\n### 1) Raise chickens\n\nWe now have 3 adorably stupid chickens, meet Dorothy (The white one), Rose (The black one) and Blanche (The brown one), yes, they are named after The Golden Girls\n\n         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Alex Foxleigh (@foxleigh81) \n\nWe don't plan on eating them, they are egg layers only, so we treat them pretty much like pets, I've learned a lot about chicken husbandry this year and I think that once the new chicken run is complete in a week or two, they will be amongst the happiest chickens in the UK :)\n\nThat leads me on nicely to \n\n### 2) Learn how to be profiecient at DIY (Specifically woodwork)\n\nWhen we first got the chickens, we didn't know how much room they needed and we took advice from a salesperson who suggested that a [TINY house and run](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBtmBwhn-cu/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) would be fine for up to 4 chickens, they were just out of 'chick' stage when we got them and were tiny but even then it didn't take long for us to see that they were distressed being confined to such a small run. So I decided to take the plunge and build them a much bigger one in our garden.\n\n         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Alex Foxleigh (@foxleigh81) \n\nIt turned out terribly and is an eyesore, however it gave me the taste for it and I decided to also build them a house, which took me a solid 2 months of weekends to complete but it [actually turned out to be pretty nice](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBtlr2-HMOx/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). That was going to be the end of it but in September, our allotment steward gave us permission to move the Chickens to our plot (which is conveniently, right behind our house). So I decided to build them a new, even bigger run. This evolved into me building them a proper chicken coop, with a house and everything. I was off work at the time so I decided to really exercise my new DIY chops and went all-out. \n\nThe run itself is a solid 20% bigger than the one they had before, their old house will be moved into the run with the entire front-panel and egg-box removed so they can use it as a run/rain shelter whilst still being outside.\n\nThe house is now a small shed, which has a huge rollaway egg box (keeping the eggs poop-free) and has solar powered heating to keep them warm. It even has two CCTV cameras in there so we can monitor them from inside.\n\nI'll update this article with a photo of the finished product when it's done but I can tell you that the quality of the new run is vastly better than the old one and I'm incredibly proud that I can now call myself a woodworker. I even built myself a new office desk!\n\n         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Alex Foxleigh (@foxleigh81)",

                "body": "2020 was not a year of succeeding in my goals. I don't share a lot of peoples high hopes for 2021, so these goals will be 'pandemic appropriate'\n\n\n## 1) Maintain a sustainable weight loss... continued\n\nLast year, I didn't manage to achieve any weight loss, in fact I ended the year 0.6lbs heavier. This year, I really hope to change that. Before lockdown hit, I was on track to lose around 1/2lb a week, if I can continue that this year I can potentially lose almost 2 stone, which would be great. I'm not setting that as a target, I'm just sticking to the goal of sustained (and sustainable) weight loss.\n\n## 2) Get my finances in order ... continued\n\nThis one is something of a tall order as we are saving to get some house renovations done, which means getting rid of my credit card debt isn't really the highest priority, I'm still going to put some money towards it though so hopefully I'll be able to make some headway, if I have managed to knock 50% off the balance by the years end, I'll consider this a win.\n\nI also want to do some serious financial detoxing and sort my budget out properly. Time to be a grown-up with money, finally. That also means I need to stop my frivolous spending, I've got enough 'stuff' and it looks like I'm not going on holiday any time soon so I really don't need to be spending as much as I am.\n\n## 3) Write more\n\nSo as you can probably see by the dates on my previous blog posts; I've not been writing much lately. I run a few other blogs and I've written a little bit more on them but still not very much. My goal is to do at least one post per month on average on each blog. I'd also like to get back into my fiction writing. Finishing my first draft of Emily Bell would be great but any non-fiction writing that I actually complete a draft of will do for me to consider this a success.\n\n## 4) Launch a software project\n\nI've been a coder for decades now and I must admit, my love for out of hours coding has diminished considerably over the years. I want to rectify that a little bit this year though, I've had some really cool projects in my head for a while and I'd like to get at least one of them done this year. Even if it doesn't make me any money, I'll at least have another project to talk about with clients which is always a good thing.\n\n---\n\nThat's it for this year. I'd love to think that I'll be able to get some more home renovations done or start attending the gym more often but I'm afraid I don't really have a huge amount of faith that we'll get our 'normal' lives back any time soon, we might be lucky in the back end of the year but I'm not even sure about that prospect. So the goals above feel like they are achievable even if I can't leave my home for the next 12 months. Check back in 2022 to see how I got on!",

                "body": "With the recent release of the 40 minute video from Adobe promoting their fifth incarnation of their Creative Suite software, we compile the greatest features on offer to web designers and developers.\n\n\n## Anticipation of launch\n\nToday saw the long awaited launch of Adobe&apos;s fifth incarnation of its Creative Suite software. New releases from Adobe are often highly anticipated events. Indeed this year I found myself watching the &apos;countdown to launch&apos; timer for almost 25 minutes.\n\nIn the past I have found myself underwhelmed with some of the releases. Most notably; Creative Suite 4, which - for me - added very little in terms of functionality. CS5 &emdash; it appears &emdash; is an _essential_ upgrade.\n\nIf you wish to watch the full video yourself, it is available here: [http://cs5launch.adobe.com/](http://cs5launch.adobe.com/) the webcast only played the first 40 minutes but the full version is 60 minutes as it also includes a preview for the included &apos;Omniture&apos; program, which seems to be amazing for people who are interested in performance tracking.\n\n## First impressions\n\nI already knew about CS5&apos;s amazing new &apos;content-aware fill&apos; but it seemed so amazing (and coupled with the fact it was first shown on April 1st) that I found it very hard to believe.  Today its existence was not only confirmed but also showed a great deal more amazing features which made me thankful I was not drinking a cup of coffee at my PC, or  I would have ended up with a very wet screen.\n\n## Rundown of features\n\nLet&apos;s start with everyone&apos;s favourite package in the Creative Suite.\n\n### Photoshop\n\nPhotoshop by far received the most updates and is definitely the thing to be the most excited about. Two of the stand-out features are:\n\n**Content-Aware Fill** &emdash; This is the most exciting part of this year&apos;s release. Its downside is the fact that a _lot_ of people have long based their jobs around the ability to remove detail from a photograph whilst seemingly leaving the background intact. Whilst these people will still be required for the very complex jobs, Photoshop will now happily do most of the work for them. In fact for _most_ images, it will replace them entirely.\n\n![An animated screenshot of Adobe CS5 removing a horse from the foreground of a photo of a field.](https://res.cloudinary.com/foxleigh/image/upload/v1643721423/Adobe_CS_5_Content_Aware_Fill_0324ce1be2.gif)\n\nIn terms of how it works. I really can only recommend watching the [video example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH0aEp1oDOI \"Youtube Video of what Content Aware Fill can do.\"); it seems nothing short of witchcraft.\n\n**Smart Selection tools** &emdash; One of the most annoying parts of image manipulation (and again the focus of many a job) is masking, the process of removing an object from its background. This has always been a difficult job for anything with a complex background, especially if that subject had hair or fur. If the example on the video is to be believed this is now as simple as a few clicks of the mouse and takes only seconds.\n\n### Dreamweaver\n\nDreamweaver gets a worryingly short mention. In fact it felt like the entire web-premium section was shorter than the others. That&apos;s not to suggest it is feature-free though:\n\n**Enhanced Live view** &emdash; Dreamweaver can now display your dynamic web page within the application as if it was already live on the server. This appears to work really well and will certainly make site development and testing a hell of a lot easier. **Browser Lab &emdash;** A major point of annoyance for all (conscientious) web developers is that in order to be able to test your website in other browsers you need to have them installed. This is fine for the most part but testing in Macintosh Safari or previous versions of IE can often require access to another machine. Browser lab can apparently render perfect examples of what the site will look like from within its own standalone application. It even allows side-by-side comparisons and onion-skinning.\n\n![A Screenshot of Dreamweaver from Adobe CS5](https://res.cloudinary.com/foxleigh/image/upload/v1643721422/Adobe_CS_5_Dreamweaver_CS_5_4194f9aa45.jpg)\n\n### Flash\n\n**Flash Catalyst** &emdash; I&apos;ve never been a fan of developing in Flash, it&apos;s awkward and I did not want to have to learn ActionScript. Flash Catalyst will take your designs from your Illustrator, InDesign or even Photoshop and automatically convert it into a flash animation. Everything else is preset actions and drag-and-drop. **Element**\\\\-**element text flow &emdash;** One of the parts about Flash I hated the most was how when you import text into a layout and that text is split across elements. Editing it at a later date can be a nightmare as you inevitably have to refit all the text to the other elements.  It is now possible to link the elements together and the text will smoothly flow between them. **Automatic iPhone app creation** &emdash; I must confess, this is something you will need to read into as I cannot guarantee this information is 100% accurate. The video implies it is now possible to automatically convert ANY Flash application into a native iPhone app and automatically submit it for inclusion into the Apple App Store.\n\n### Premiere Pro and After Effects\n\nI know video editing is not part of the Web Suite but these days being able to edit video for the web is definitely a good skill to have.\n\n**Automatic Rotoscoping** &emdash; This feature blew my mind; rotoscoping has always been a difficulty, even when against a chroma-key (green/blue screen) background it can be difficult. Premiere CS5 allows you to create a rough selection in one frame, it will then use the smart selection tools to automatically find the outline and mask it on that frame. Sounds good yeah? If you then advance to the next frame ready to do it again, you&apos;d find that Premiere has already done it for you. That&apos;s right, manual rotoscoping is history.\n\n![A screenshot example of Adobe CS5 rotoscoping tool](https://res.cloudinary.com/foxleigh/image/upload/v1643721422/Adobe_CS_5_Rotoscoping_1_d770c90ae1.jpg)\n\n**Mercury Playback Engine** &emdash; This is a 64Bit only feature but the benefit of this is that the more RAM you have the more you can use premiere in real-time. Even more amazingly, if you have an NVidia GPU (Not sure about other manufacturers yet). Your GPU itself will be utilised to allow for on-the-fly editing and composition. You can make changes to the video whilst it is playing. The example here shows the result of the above rotoscoping on live playback:\n\n![A screenshot example of Adobe CS5 rotoscoping tool](https://res.cloudinary.com/foxleigh/image/upload/v1643721422/Adobe_CS_5_Rotoscoping_2_c5158df621.jpg)\n\n### Business Catalyst\n\nTo be honest this feature is more of a worry to me than an excitement - I have seen companies create &apos;web building&apos; applications before and they nearly always result in a poorly made site, simply put; software has not yet developed the ability to think creatively and until it does there is no substitute for a real web designer. Watching it at work however is amazing, it seems to give people who do not have the ability to program code to build rich, dynamic applications. Again I&apos;m not sure this is a particularly good thing as I am concerned that it will increase the opinion that &apos;anyone can be a web designer&apos;. However once I get my hands on the product and am able to have a play myself I will try to give a balanced review.\n\n## My opinion\n\nI do not think I have been more excited about an Adobe release since the introduction of the Effects panel back in the late 90&apos;s. This is a must-have upgrade for any current users.\n\nOne of the things I have not really mentioned in this review is the &apos;live services&apos; feature, this includes features such as live technology trending data (including browser popularity), instant collaboration and online creative feedback which integrates within the suite&apos;s applications.\n\nAs soon as I am able to get my hands on the suite I will post a more comprehensive review.\n\n_Disclaimer: All of the images utilised in this article are taken from the Adobe website.

                "body": "My hopes for 2021 were about as grim as I predicted and once again I did not quite manage to achieve my goals. However, in November, I discovered a possible reason why I struggled so much to reach my goals and in December it was confirmed: I have ADHD and Autism. \n\nAs a result, I'll give myself a bit of a break here, I actually did manage to achieve one of my goals and I've actually made a ton of headway with another. So I'll call it a win.\n\n## 1) Maintain a sustainable weight loss... failed\n\nI actually did really well with this for a while but I have struggled to sustain it in a way that I'm happy with. I started to feel a ton of mental pressure in the latter 1/2 of the year - in fact it was this that encouraged me to seek my ADHD diagnosis - but that caused me to put aside my weight loss goals and I did so in a big way. I have not gained a significant amount of weight in fact I think I am a little lighter than I was when the year started but only by a few lbs.\n\n## 2) Get my finances in order ... bit of both.\n\nInterestingly, I sort of succeeded here, just not in the way I thought I would. In Feburary I decided I'd have another shot at using [YNAB](https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=MlWYXiFwcokYj2Wo&utm_source=customer_referral) to make myself stick to a budget. I struggled to get my head around it when I first tried it a few years ago but this time it clicked and I've used it religiously ever since. \n\nWe've done a ton of work to the house this year and that's cost a fair bit of money, I also had to buy a new car as my old one broke down, so my credit card debt has only gone down by a few thousand pounds, however I'm now confident that I can stick to my budget and even if I don't pay it off that fast, it will still be gone within a year or two.\n\n## 3) Write more ... failed. Big time.\n\nWriting is something I desperately want to be able to get back into, a friend of mine once told me that if I wanted to be a writer then I'd write and I really took that to heart. However, now I know I have ADHD I'm willing to accept that I'm not to blame for not being able to write as much as I want to. In a few months, I'll be medicated and will hopefully find all of this much easier.\n\n## 4) Launch a software project... success!\n\nSo earlier this year, I wrote a few software applications. All of them were apps to help me with organisation, two of them are [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bots, one to help me and my wife keep our shopping list in sync and the other is to help me automatically save my receipts to Dropbox. The other app is a Python app (which I've never written in before) which allows me and my wife to catalogue our large library of books and implement a dewey decimal system using [Notion](https://notion.so) as a data store.\n\n---\n\nThe revelation that I have ADHD and autism has reframed my sense of who I am and is still something I am coming to terms with. I've also not yet started medication which may take a few months before I am on the right meds for me. I am still going to write a goals list for the year but I think I will wait a little while before I write it as right now feels a little premature.",

                "body": "It has been said by many that depression is the black death of the 21st century, whilst this is a bit of an exaggeration (it doesn&apos;t kill people directly,nor makes them come out in boils), I do understand where the comparison comes from, whilst not really infectious, it is a product of our society just as the bubonic plague was a product of theirs, it spreads silently through our world, feeding on the stresses caused by our daily, unfulfilling lives, those who suffer from it can go their entire lives without ever even knowing what is wrong with them, countless others fail to seek help and suffer in silence. Why does this happen?\n\n\n\nBecause depression is hugely misunderstood. It&apos;s not something that everyone gets from time-to-time, it is a legitimate mental illness which can be just as crippling as a broken back.\n\nIn 2001 I was diagnosed with clinical depression. Frankly I did not believe it and refused the offer of antidepressants or therapy, I didn&apos;t refuse to believe it out of pride; it was ignorance. I have always been a little bit sad, my life had always been difficult and I figured I had just grown used to feeling disappointed with life. In my mind, I wasn&apos;t ill. I was just cynical.\n\nIt took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I actually had a mental illness, my girlfriend at the time had to tell me that I&apos;d stopped caring about anything before I even realised that anything was truly wrong with me. It eventually reached a point where the only thing that could elicit an emotional response from me at all was television.\n\nAt around the same time, my friend who we shall call &apos;Steve&apos; (because that was his name) started to come over to my house a lot more, we would spend days at a time (neither of us had jobs) just watching Joss Whedon shows over and over again. We had nothing to do, nothing to live for and I didn&apos;t care.\n\nI&apos;m sure it sounds to you that Steve was also depressed, however this is where the distinction must be drawn. Steve was not depressed, Steve had the blues.\n\nRecently he had lost his job, it was a job he had loved and he earned a reasonable amount of money doing. Once that job had gone, he had nothing. This upset him and when you mix sadness with boredom it becomes almost indistinguishable from depression. He came to see me almost daily - often staying over on my sofa - and he started to behave like me because people who have the blues find people who suffer from depression to be easy company: We don&apos;t care enough to try to snap you out of it.\n\nI on the other had, had many jobs over the years and - with the exception of the first one which I was made redundant from in 1998 - I quit them all (or was fired), I had a girlfriend whom I loved dearly and who felt the same way about me; I treat her like a servant. I had a reasonably nice house which I constantly made a mess of and I had some money - granted it wasn&apos;t much (job seekers allowance) but it was enough to live on - I blew it all on unhealthy food and DVD Box sets allowing my girlfriend to support my living expenses.\n\nSteve was sad because the life he had worked hard on had been taken from him. My life was fine and I sabotaged it at every step of the way.\n\nI look back on the person I used to be and I cannot identify with him, that guy wasn&apos;t me, it was as though someone had locked my actual personality up and replaced me with an absolutely horrible excuse for a human being.\n\nThis is the part where people start to say &apos;Oh you just want sympathy because you were lazy&apos; but here is the part that people don&apos;t really get: I don&apos;t want sympathy, I WAS being lazy, I didn&apos;t care about my situation or the people I was hurting because of it, I don&apos;t want sympathy because it wasn&apos;t really me, it was an imposter. I have so much gratitude for my ex girlfriend (in fact I stayed with her for many years after our relationship went stale, out of guilt because I felt like I owed her so much) and my family as I have no idea how they coped with me, I never showered, I ate nothing but junk food and I rarely left the sofa, let alone the house. If it weren't for my ex and my family actually forcing me into action, I may possibly still be in the same situation.\n\nYou may be asking yourself what happened to me to make me feel sad, but if you are then I&apos;ve still not quite explained it well enough to you yet:\n\nDepression isn&apos;t about being sad, you aren&apos;t. It&apos;s not about being angry, you aren&apos;t.\n\nIt&apos;s about feeling nothing. That is the problem, nothing gets you down, nothing makes you angry, nothing makes you happy. You don&apos;t care about anything.\n\nIn fact, in many ways; depression is wonderful, if the world was happy to provide you with everything you&apos;d ever need without you making any effort; depression wouldn&apos;t be a problem at all. Depression is basically your mind looking at the world and saying “Nope, this is too much to cope with, time to switch off”. The reason why depression is so bad is because it&apos;s so easy to be depressed, the hard part comes when you decide to stop being depressed.\n\nTry to imagine the feeling that you get on a cold winter's day, the heating isn&apos;t on and you are tucked up in bed next to the love of your life. You are so warm, so happy.\n\nSuddenly your alarm goes off; it&apos;s time to get up and go to work and it&apos;s not a job you love, it&apos;s a horrible job which you hate with a passion. Suddenly you feel like getting out of bed is the hardest thing anyone has ever had to do, you stare at the alarm clock, willing time to turn back so you can just stay warm for a little while longer.\n\nThat feeling that you all have experienced is how a depressed person feels all of the time, it&apos;s safe, warm and cozy inside the little bubble we have created for ourselves. Leaving that bubble and entering the world isn&apos;t a question of making the effort. We are not lazy for wanting to stay there. The outside world is terrifying, dangerous and if we take a wrong step, it will kill us.\n\nMany people like to tell us to &apos;get over it&apos;, however there is no &apos;it&apos; to get over, it&apos;s like telling someone to get over the fact they have a head. It&apos;s not something that will go away, it is a part of them and it always will be.\n\nIt&apos;s been over a decade since my diagnosis and I still suffer from depression, I always will. Once you learn to accept depression as an actual illness, you learn that - like any chronic illness - you just have to learn how to manage it effectively and like anything that you put a lot of effort into, it becomes something you can tolerate. The urge to retreat inside myself and flip the switch to the &apos;off&apos; position again is still there every single day of my life and most likely always will be but now my mind has trained itself to tell it one word every morning.\n\n“Fight!”\n\nWhen I first started to manage my depression, it began with getting a job. It was an awful job that I did not enjoy at all, I stuck at it for a few months and then quit. That was fine though, everybody slips and I had people who would keep pushing me, realising that one of my major catalysts for depression was inactivity. Slowly but surely I managed to get myself to a stage where if I was at a job I couldn&apos;t cope with, I&apos;d find another one first before I left. Eventually I was in a position where I managed to remain in regular employment.\n\nI started to treat my girlfriend like a person again, unfortunately our relationship was severely tarnished (and understandably so) by my actions (or lack thereof) in the past and although we had a good run we did eventually part ways in 2010, really it should have ended sooner but I did not have the strength of mind to see that.\n\nThe long term effects of depression are always there, my memory is now shockingly bad (although it is slowly improving) and my emotional response to things is still not what would be referred to as &apos;normal&apos; (I smile when I should be shocked, I cannot cry over anything that isn&apos;t fictional etc...) but you learn to live with these things after a while.\n\nToday I have an amazing life, I have a job that I love, I have hobbies that keep my mind occupied and I am constantly finding ways to improve my life. Am I still depressed? Yes, of course I am.\n\nEvery morning I struggle to get out of bed, all day I fight the urge to quit my job and go home, eating right and exercising feels like a herculean task. However I am now aware of my mental issues and because of this, I DO fight. In fact, knowing that I am able to live my life as if I were a completely normal person every day makes me feel incredibly proud.\n\nI&apos;d be lying if I said it got easier, it never has done so far, however my ability to cope has grown stronger.\n\nI&apos;ll always have depression but that doesn&apos;t mean I have to be depressed. Life is for living and I intend to do just that.\n\n_For more of an insight into depression, I highly recommend the book &apos;[I Had A Black Dog&apos;](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Had-Black-Dog-Matthew-Johnstone/dp/1845295897/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1334755296&sr=8-1) it explains the illness in a way so simplistic that even a child could understand it._",

                "title": "The problem with front-end development recruitment",
                "body": "I've been building websites for a [_very_](http://www.alexward.me.uk/skills) long time. When I first started back in the mid-late 90's there wasn't much of a distinction between front-end developers and back-end developers, we all had to know everything, you couldn't specialise as there wasn't really much of a need for that. \"Build me a website\" was about as much spec as you could expect.\n\nFast-forward a decade or so and the landscape became very different indeed, now specialism was where it was at, if you wanted to develop for the web (and didn't want to be full-stack) then your choices were clear, it was either 'front-end' or 'back-end'.\n\nThe differences couldn't have been larger, front-end developers were often creative types (I referred to myself as a web designer until around 2008), for us, the joy of building a website came from turning code into something visual that we could see come to life. Learning HTML and CSS was like learning to wield a paintbrush. As JavaScript matured, we also started to use that (mainly through the jQuery framework) as it helped us to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model - a fancy term for the elements of a page) and create some really cool animations.\n\nBack-end developers dealt with data, their joy came from manipulating numbers and strings, finding terser ways to create complex functions and do some truly amazing things with vast and complex data-structures.\n\n**Then came NodeJS and everything went wrong.**\n\nDon't misunderstand me, this post is not a rant about Node, Angular, React or the countless other JavaScript frameworks out there, I work with Node and React quite a bit and I actually think they are amazing. The only problem I have with these frameworks is that although they are _technically_ front-end development, they are spiritually back-end development and that's not what I signed on for.\n\n## **The job specification conundrum**\n\nMost of the problem rests with nomenclature, in the recruitment market front-end developer, web developer, front-end engineer, UI developer, UX developer etc... are all interchangeable terms. This confusion has spread so far that many developers don't really know what to call themselves.\n\nThe problem is compounded by non-technical people writing job specs. I suspect a lot of the time, job specs are filled with buzz wordy skills that people think they need, so at the moment nearly every job is calling out for React or Angular whereas, if you are technical enough to know these languages; you'll realise that it's highly unlikely that these projects would even benefit from using those technologies.\n\nThe amount of times I've seen a spec which lists several competing tools as requirements is too damn high, sure it's possible that a project uses gulp, grunt _and_ webpack but it's unlikely. It's even more unlikely that a project will use React, Angular and Ember all together and yet they are all listed as essential skills.\n\nThis of course is not a new problem, I can't even count the times I've seen C# listed as an essential skill for a UI Developer, the issue probably began with the hiring manager asking a techie what sort of skills they need and they will have replied \"someone who knows a JS framework, like React, Angular or Ember\" and the hiring manager just writing \"must know JS, React, Angular, Ember\" in their notes. All subsequent technical projects will just copy/paste the same spec and edit the wording a bit and thus the problem persists.\n\n## **Why this matters today**\n\nAs a contractor, I can tell you now that 90% of interviews I go to are utter rubbish, very few people know how to really test if a developer knows his stuff and quite often, the technical lead on a project is a back-end developer, so when they are put in charge of interviewing someone to fill the front-end role, they use their own frame of reference to test them. HTML and CSS is difficult to unit test so often the tech tests will be JavaScript based, even if JS isn't really much of a requirement.\n\nThe problem with this is that back-end developers often have a massively different mindset to front-end developers. [Take a look a this list of portfolio sites](https://github.com/dargaCode/PortfolioExamples) and it's not hard to see which ones are back-end and which ones are front-end, you don't even need to look at their skills list, the distinction is obvious, front-end developers have great UI's with content that cuts to the chase whereas back-end developers have a lot of text and a lot of lists. Why? **Because back-end developers care about data and front-end developers care about interfaces.**\n\nSo, if you place too much focus on the JavaScript side when hiring your developers, you'll end up with a team of people who are amazing at structuring and manipulating data but you'll pay a penalty with the UI.\n\nWant an example? A backend developer would look at this code and possibly see no issue, a front-end developer would shudder in horror:\n\n \n```html  \n  <div id=\"navigation\"> \n    <p>\n    <a href=\"/link1\" style=\"color: red\"><span><b>Link 1</b></span></a> | \n    <a href=\"/link2\"><span>Link 2</span></a> | \n    <a href=\"/link3\"><span>Link 3</span></a> | \n    <a href=\"/link4\"><span>Link 4</span></a></p> \n</div>\n\n```\n \n\nThat actually hurt to write.\n\nThat's just HTML as well, everything gets a lot more complex when you throw things like CSS, accessibility, browser compatibility, progressive enhancement, responsive design, preprocessors and usability into the mix (to name but a few!). UI Development is complex enough without having to also keep on top of the constantly changing world of JavaScript frameworks.\n\n**So what's the answer?**\n\nThis one is actually quite simple. Front-end and back-end don't really make sense as terms anymore, it was find when client-side code (the front-end) and server-side code (the back-end) were hugely different but now the waters have mixed a little it makes sense to chance the nomenclature.\n\nSo I propose we call them what they are: **UI Developer, Front-end engineer** and **Back-end Engineer.**\n\n**UI Developers** concern themselves entirely with the User Interface, they specialise in HTML and CSS, they know tons about usability, accessibility and device/browser compatibility. The only JavaScript they'd be expected to know will be stuff that concerns manipulating UI elements (either in the DOM or the Shadow-DOM), form validation and of course keeping up with tools like package managers, task runners and whatever preprocessors are flavour of the month.\n\n**Front-end engineers** concern themselves with client-side scripting, this is stuff like how to manipulate APIs, how to set up client-side routing, how to set up isomorphic rendering etc... They will be expected to keep up with the latest frameworks and will have an intimate knowledge of Vanilla JavaScript.\n\n**Back-end Engineers** are the traditional back-end developers, they concern themselves with all the complex functions and systems that go hand-in hand with the manipulation of large amounts of data and the management of those systems.\n\nObviously there will be people with skill overlap (personally I'd consider myself a UI Developer with a bit of Front-end engineer thrown in for good measure) but most people specialise somewhere and that is what recruiters should focus on.\n\nNobody wants a world where everyone is a full-stack developer, it may seem good for the bottom line to hire one developer instead of two or three but that path has terrible websites at the end of it and a bad website = unhappy customers = lost money. A formula that I'm sure most businesses will agree, isn't a recipe for success.",

                "body": "[Last year I set myself a few life goals](/mind-body-and-soul/2012-not-the-end-the-beginning/ \"2012: Not the end, the beginning!\"), and whilst I didn't do too badly, I did not do anywhere near as well as I wanted to this year, I have some different plans and a continuation of some of the same ones. Let's see how this year plays out.\n\nSo how did I do at last years goals? Here is a run-down:\n\n**Reach target weight of 155lbs: Semi-failed** Annoyingly, I'm only about 2lb lighter than this time last year; however, I am considerably thinner as I've managed to replace a fair amount of the fat with muscle. I'm still nowhere near the fitness level I want to be; though I am thinner, I'm still a big lad, and I'd like that to change.\n\n\\*\\*Attend martial arts classes: Technical \\*\\***Success** I DID attend a martial arts class. I went for about three months until the cost became prohibitive. However, it did become almost enjoyable. I probably won't attend another class this year as I intend to focus more on body toning than weight loss, and I feel that the gym will be more than enough for that.\n\n**Set up a sustainable recycling system: Success and failure at the same time** My approach is not much different from last year, I've added an extra bin for compostable waste, but that's about it. However I've gotten a lot better at organising it, each bin has a different place in the kitchen now, and I manage it quite well.\n\n**Get a hidden litter tray for puddles (My Cat): Success due to moving the goal-posts.** The original intention was to get a hidden litter tray; however, I instead managed to [find one](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Omega-Paw-Rolln-Cleaning-Litter/dp/B0002DK2DU/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&qid=1357133539&sr=8-16) which was REALLY easy to maintain; whilst it's not hidden, it looks a lot tidier than the old one I had, and it never smells.\n\n**Buy some plants: Success** I now have a mini herb garden on my windowsill which I manage to kill completely every few months, however, the plants are cheap and easy to replace so I still count it as a win.\n\n**Buy new shelves: Success** I now have some really nice '[Billy bookcase](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/S79893865/#/S49858180)' shelves from Ikea which have solved my storage problem and then some.\n\n**Find a way to make more space and I want a new desk: Success** I worked out that I never use my kitchen table so I converted it into a desk which freed up a lot of space in my flat, I am about to move and I can't take the table with me so both of these points are now moot.\n\n**Attend at least two college courses: Utter Failure** I stopped attending the one course I was on and never picked another up. However again, the goals changed a little here, once my course finished I and a few friends on that course decided to start our own writing group which has proven to be of great value to me.\n\n**Read one book per week: Close but no cigar** I have managed about two books per month, however, I've been reading some quite long books this year (including some very difficult reads) so I still consider this a reasonable achievement.\n\n**Finish either Emily Bell, The Ghost of you or preferably; both: Fail** I've been terrible at writing this year, the first half I did really well and made some great progress, [I wrote a short story called Harry's Song](/scribblings/harrys-song-and-the-power-of-free/ \"Harry's Song and the power of free\") which is the first story I've ever managed to finish, however, I've not written anything on my novels since September. This will change in 2013 though.\n\n**Learn to Drive: Complete and total failure** I never made any progress on this goal at all.\n\n**Begin learning an instrument: Technical success.** I bought a ukulele and inherited an electric keyboard. I did begin to start playing the former but I'm still terrible and I've not touched it in months.\n\n<br>\nSo I didn't do TERRIBLY but I made nowhere near as much progress I wanted to. I'll be making a new goals list soon so let's see how I do this year!",

                "title": "Android update for Milestone finally hits the UK",
                "body": "After a fairly long wait behind the rest of the west, the UK Milestone finally received the update to 2.1. Here is a quick rundown of its new features and instructions on where to get your hands on it.\n\nThis morning Engadget [reported](http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/06/milestone-gets-android-2-1-update-in-uk-available-to-download-n/) the long-awaited release of the 2.1 (Eclair) update for the UK edition of the Motorola Milestone. We have already downloaded and tested it and so far, we think it&apos;s great. Here are the features it has added along with our impressions.\n\n## Live Wallpapers\n\nOne of the things that made Milestone users jealous of the Google Nexus one was the touch-sensitive video wallpapers they had access to, now with 2.1 we have them as well.\n\n### Our Impression\n\nSo far this is my favourite feature, I&apos;ve always been a fan of animated wallpapers and the Android version is fantastic. The stock wallpapers included with the update are rather lacklustre though, however downloading new ones (including the nexus one wallpaper &emdash; although this one is not all that stable) is as simple as visiting the Market.\n\n## More home screens\n\nI initially worried that three home screens would be difficult to get used to after owning an iPhone, I have to say though I really did not have any issue with it. Evidentally some people did though as the new update now allows you to have upto 9 home screens on your device.\n\n### Our Impression\n\nIf you are a heavy user of widgets then this feature is probably great for you, however I only have a few widgets and I find the tab menu easy enough to navigate so for me this feature does not add a great deal more functionality.\n\n## Facebook pre-installed\n\nThis update is understandable given the current nature of the web, it seems now that Facebook is becoming the number one use of the internet for many people so it seems like a smart move to include it with the update.\n\n### Our Impression\n\nAs far as I can tell there have been no changes from the Facebook app which is available on the market, as I already had this installed anyway I saw no benefit from the update.\n\n## Google Maps update\n\nThere have been various updates to the built-in Google Maps application. Most notable of which is the inclusion of multi-touch functionality. They have also added features such as auto-complete and account synchronisation.\n\n### Our Impression\n\nPinch-to-zoom is definitely a welcome update and really is one that should have already existed. The other features are definitely handy but will probably not see much regular use.\n\n## Camera updates\n\nFor me the best update by far is the camera application, video and still modes are now separate items in the menu and the interface for the camera app itself has been drastically overhauled.\n\n### Our Impression\n\nThis update for me offers the greatest improvement of the full upgrade, the camera was one of the worst interfaces I had used in quite a long time, it was clunky and poorly thought out. The new update sports an intuitive design and is much more responsive.\n\n## Overall impression\n\nThe update is definitely a welcome one, however considering how long we have waited for this it really doesn&apos;t seem to have made a difference. My main hope is that it contains a number of bug-fixes as it does seem that the Milestone does suffer from a few stability issues on occasion.\n\nOne point to note is that since the update this morning, my multimedia station no longer has access to its &apos;docked&apos; mode and instead just crashes to the home-screen. Hopefully this is not the case for all devices and the ones who are affected will receive another update soon. If you are affected by this bug please let us know in the comments so we can update this to an official warning.\n\n_EDIT: This is an official bug but users have already found a solution, simply delete the applications cache ([instructions in this thread](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=7694#c5)) and it works like a charm._\n\nIn my opinion, the update is worth doing, it brings some features to the table which were sorely needed and my phone appears to run slightly faster (although that may just be in my mind), however it is nothing to get overly excited about.\n\n## How to upgrade\n\nUpgrading is remarkably simple, simply visit [http://direct.motorola.com/hellomoto/support/update/](http://direct.motorola.com/hellomoto/support/update/) and follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nA full list of changes can be found [here (PDF)](https://rsddownload.motorola.com/download/MILESTONE_Upgrade_Android_2.1__March_24_2010.pdf)",

                "body": "Becoming a contractor can be a daunting experience for anyone, I am currently going through the early stages of it so I am going to document my successes and failures here in the hope that I can help other people take the plunge and guide them on their own journey to freedom.\n\nOn the 19th of April I left a lucrative Front-end position at a very prestigious digital agency. On that Friday I went to the pub with my now former colleagues and the inevitable question was asked: “So… where are you moving on to then?”\n\nAs a brand-new contractor, that was the worst question I could have been asked and it was one I was semi-dreading. I did not know where I was going, the only thing which was certain about the next few weeks of my life was that there was no certainty about it at all.\n\nA month later and I&apos;ve already had two contracts and I am getting offers all of the place for other ones. Whilst it&apos;s still new enough to feel fairly scary. I am no longer worried about a lack of work. It&apos;s true that I have no idea where I will be in a few weeks but that is all part of the excitement.\n\n## Why did I do it?\n\nSimply put, I was getting stuck in a rut in my old job. I have worked in the web industry since 1998 and over the years had developed a formidable set of skills, including front-end and backend development, print and web design, 3D modelling and copywriting. However whilst at my last permanent position, I was only a front-end developer. I never got the chance to use any of my other skills, at first it was fine, I loved (and still love) the company I was working for so I honestly didn&apos;t mind my scope being limited. In fact it was kind of nice to only be responsible for one area.\n\nI stayed with the company for three years. During that time, my front-end skills were solidified and honed but it was at the expense of my other skills. I tried to write a PHP application a few months ago and even though I managed to do it, it took me longer than it would have done a few years ago and it took a great deal of googling in order to re-learn some of the things which I had forgotten over the years.\n\nAs a contractor, I will have the opportunity to keep all of my skills fresh, I can choose roles based on which skills I want to work on at the time.\n\nThere are other, more obvious benefits to contracting of course, in two weeks at my current day rate, I have earned more than I would have earned in a month at my old salary, I get to meet new people all the time and best of all. I am my own boss. My current contract ends this friday and it&apos;s entirely up to me if I take another one starting the following week. I don&apos;t have to book holidays or worry about availability. I just decide not to accept any contracts for the period I wish to be off.\n\n## How have I found work?\n\nGenerally speaking, I&apos;m very much a &apos;measure twice, cut once&apos; sort of person. I will plan something to the nth degree before I will actually move forward. So, several years ago when I started working in my previous role. I decided that eventually, I would become a contractor. This is where my preparation process began. I signed up for LinkedIn and added anyone I worked with who I felt may be a useful person to stay in contact with in the future. I made sure that people in the digital industry knew who I was and over the course of three years. I gave myself a concrete network of people in the Leeds digital industry.\n\nWhen I became available for contracting it was simply a case of getting my website online, getting myself registered with a few key agencies (I&apos;ll speak more about those in my next post) and then making the announcement that I was available on social media sites.\n\nAll of this planning paid off as so far I have had three contract offers based on recommendation alone. Even though I am registered through the agencies, I have yet to use them, as my contract offers have all been direct. In fact, so far (although it is early days) I have not received a solid offer from an agency at all. Whilst I know a lot of contractors swear by agencies, so far all I&apos;ve seen is a lot of posturing. I&apos;m hoping that changes soon though as I suspect recommendations will only take me so far.\n\nThere are upsides and downsides to this of course. Getting &apos;in&apos; with an agency will make it much easier to find work during quiet periods, plus many agencies pay weekly so you don&apos;t have to worry so much about managing your cashflow or chasing clients.\n\nThe upside to going direct is purely a matter of money. I can command a higher day-rate if I go direct, in fact I would lose around 20% of my day-rate through an agent. Although I would say that given the option, I would still prefer to get work through a reputable agency as it feels more secure, somehow.\n\n## Do I have any advice to give?\n\nI think it&apos;s too early in my contracting career to start acting like an old salt and giving out advice. However I will say this, contracting is a great option for anyone with a valuable set of skills and the experience to back them up.\n\nHowever I wouldn&apos;t recommend quitting a well-paying and/or enjoyable job without putting some serious preparation time into it. Spend some time researching the market rates and availability for your skill-set, speak to other contractors, talk with an accountant and a solicitor so you understand exactly what you are getting yourself into and make sure people in your industry are familiar with your face. Go to networking events and industry social events. The more people who know your name and what you are capable of, the higher the chances that you will manage to keep the work flowing.\n\nAnd above all else… Good luck!",

                "title": "Five months later: A (disgruntled) re-review of the Motorola Milestone.",
                "body": "As you may remember, back in March I did a [review of the Motorola Milestone](/technically-minded/review-motorola-milestone-uk/). This was the non-US equivalent of the popular Motorola Droid. Five months later and I am not happy...\n\nAs I expected, the Motorola Milestone is already [yesterdays Jam](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=yesterdays+jam&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&client=firefox-a), with new Android handsets coming out with frightening regularity my once-beloved phone now seems ancient. Of course there is little point being upset as this is the march of progress at work and does not diminish my phone&apos;s value, however I have noticed that the &apos;bored now&apos; factor is much higher with Android phones than it is with the iPhone simply because new ones are always being released.\n\n### Hardware:\n\nI did have some concern that the sliding mechanism would become loose after a while but so far it is still working wonderfully. None of the ports have worn and the phone is surprisingly scratch resistant. In fact I have given this phone some punishment and it doesn&apos;t have a mark on it.\n\n### Software:\n\nA few months ago Motorola decided to push out its 2.1 android update, as the phone uses a vanilla android install I am unsure why it took so long, indded the only additions are annoying and irremovable Motorola apps such as &apos;MotoNav&apos;, which is utterly useless as Google Maps now ships with free navigation as opposed to the slow and paid-for version Motorola tries to push on us.\n\nThe camera has improved greatly, when I first got my phone I was quite unsure about the camera app, the interface was clunky and unresponsive and all the settings were difficult to access. Plus the camera itself was quite slow to activate. Now the camera is a lot faster and the interface is great. My only issue is that it seems to struggle more with low-light photographs, however this may be something I am doing incorrectly.\n\n### Motorola:\n\nAs you&apos;ve probably noticed so far, I don&apos;t sound all that disgruntled at all. Indeed the phone itself is still fantastic and I believe if I were living in America this review would be nothing but shining praise, however I am British and as a result Motorola seem to be content to leave me hanging. So much so that I cannot even get a response from them via email.\n\nAbout a week ago I sent them the following email (note: I get quite &apos;uppity&apos; when I am writing formal letters so I apologise if I sound like a snob)\n\n> I would like to direct your attention to the following facebook group:\n> \n> [http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=121867580498&topic=13747](http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=121867580498&topic=13747)\n> \n> I'm afraid that the original poster in this topic is correct, your reputation in Europe is taking a massive hit, a simple google or twitter search can actually see the scope of it, the reason I purchased a Milestone was because it ran an untouched version of Android and was unlocked, so I could enjoy trying out different versions of Android from the community, you can imagine my disappointment therefore when I find that you have locked the boot loader. To add insult to injury, it appears that you are not even making an effort to provide us the upgrade to Froyo, it seems you are trying to stop the development for this phone so we are forced to upgrade. Indeed this 'strategy' may work but it is unlikely we'll consider a new Motorola phone to be a viable upgrade. This feeling is what is being echoed across the Milestone-owning community.\n> \n> Secondly, I purchased the phone as it was advertised as 'flash-ready', I have had this phone for several months now and so far I still cannot use any version of flash. Therefore this phone was mis-sold to me, this is something I am quite understandably very angry about.\n> \n> I honestly believed that you guys had turned a corner and had begun to produce high-quality products, indeed the Milestone hardware could be fantastic if the software could be altered to get the most from it, to me it seems you bred a pedigree puppy and then tied its legs together.\n> \n> I hope you realise that this is a PR disaster and do what you can to improve matters for your disgruntled customers. This issue is enough for me to sell my phone and spend extra on buying one from a better manufacturer such as HTC. I for one will not be purchasing another Motorola product if these issues are not dealt with satisfactorily.\n\nFourty eight hours later, I received this email:\n\n> Dear Alexander,\n> \n> Thanks for reaching out to Motorola. Your inquiry has reached our North American office, and we do not have international product information at this location. For information specific to the product you mention in your inquiry, please contact the Motorola office that is closest to your country for further assistance. The various worldwide Motorola offices can be found by locating the following link:\n> \n> [http://www.hellomoto.com](http://www.hellomoto.com/)\n> \n> We hope that you find this information useful and look forward to assisting you in the future.\n> \n> For information about Motorola products and services, please visit us at [http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/GB-EN/Home](http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/GB-EN/Home)\n> \n> Thank you for contacting Motorola e-mail support.\n> \n> Best Regards,\n> \n> Neil Gabrido\n\n“Fair enough” I thought so I looked through their site to find a UK email address and I was dismayed to find that all links available just led me back to the same &apos;North American&apos; office as before. Now I am fully willing to admit that it is possible I would have found the appropriate contact details had I looked deepr but personally I feel it should have been easy to find and in 2010 I refuse to believe that a communications company cannot provide me with a simple regional email address so I sent them the following response:\n\n> This issue is most certainly not to my satisfaction. Your global offices do not provide email addresses on the website and you&apos;re 'contact us' pages on your 'local' websites only direct to the USA offices. I would appreciate it if you could forward this email on to a relevant office or at least provide me with an email address for the UK division.\n\nAgain two days later I received the exact same response, it seems that Motorola do not even care enough about non-US customers to even bother reading the email to check its context and immediately send out canned responses.\n\nThankfully my complaint was actually in the process of being resolved and [T3 recently reported](http://www.t3.com/news/motorola-milestone-froyo-update-coming-september?=47713) that version 2.2 is indeed going to reach the Milestone in the next few months.\n\nAll in all I am still very happy with the phone itself. I am feeling jealousy toward people who have the HTC Evo and Desire, but this is to be expected, however my dealings with Motorola have shown me that their attitude toward customers is terrible and whilst my next phone purchase will definitely still be an Android phone, it will most certainly not be a Motorola.\n\n \n\n24th August 2010 Update - Motorola have [just confirmed](http://androidos.in/2010/08/motorola-milestone-official-android-2-2-update-schedule/) that the Milestone will be getting the update to FroYo but that the rollout will start at the end of the year. This is not good enough as 3.0 will nearly be out by then. America already has it, they just keep sticking the finger up at their non-US customers.",

Part one proved itself to be invaluable as it gave me the push I needed to start writing my first novel as well as affording me the opportunity to meet some great people.\n\nPart two started this evening, it was great to see a few  familiar faces from last year as well as welcoming the new blood which have just started. This semester/term appears to focus more on plot and pacing, whereas the first part of the course was very much focused on getting your pen on the paper (or fingers on the keyboard in my case) and start writing.\n\nI have used this as an opportunity to start a new novel, granted I've not even made it halfway through my first one yet but I appear to be a little stuck and I'd read elsewhere that if you get stuck it can be good to start another story otherwise you may become complacent. Indeed that is exactly what had happened and I realised that I had not written anything in almost two months! (apart from the odd blog post).\n\nHere is a snippet of what I wrote tonight, it is the beginning of the prologue to my new novel 'The Ghost of You':\n\n> **'Your going to die alone dude' he said to the mirror, the reflection looked hurt and Anthony felt a tear in the corner of his eye, he didn't cry.\n> \n> He left the bathroom, the tub was dry, no drips fell from the shower, the only thing wet was the toilet seat, he hadn't washed his hands.\n> \n> He flopped down on the sofa and turned on his ridiculously large television, he contemplated going back to bed but it was already one in the afternoon so he decided against it. With the exception of a toilet break and getting up to make a sandwich all he did that afternoon was watch TV.\n> \n> 'Its amazing how productive you can feel watching television', Anthony thought to himself after watching his sixth episode of Fringe that afternoon, 'worrying really, I'd best do something productive'\n> \n> He left the living room and walked into his study, he turned on his computer and opened up his text editor'. 'Two hours of writing' he said to himself out loud 'and then bed'.\n> \n> He put his fingers on the keyboard but no words came out, he felt frustrated that he couldn't even manage one blog post. 'Pathetic' he heard himself say.\n> \n> 'You are not pathetic' came the reply. He knew that voice was in his head, however it sounded softer than his usual inner monologue, tender and soothing rather than bitter and angry. For a brief moment he thought he caught the whiff of perfume, he sniffed the air deeply, nothing. 'Imagining things now eh? Great, maybe going mad will give you something to do'**\n\nI hope you enjoyed that, I would be grateful for any feedback you could give me (constructive feedback only please). I shall post a little more after next week's lesson.",

                "body": "Becoming a contractor can be a daunting experience for anyone, I am currently going through the early stages of it so I am going to document my successes and failures here in the hope that I can help other people take the plunge and guide them on their own journey to freedom.\n\nOn the 19th of April I left a lucrative Front-end position at a very prestigious digital agency. On that Friday I went to the pub with my now former colleagues and the inevitable question was asked: “So... where are you moving on to then?”\n\nAs a brand-new contractor, that was the worst question I could have been asked and it was one I was semi-dreading. I did not know where I was going, the only thing which was certain about the next few weeks of my life was that there was no certainty about it at all.\n\nA month later and I&apos;ve already had two contracts and I am getting offers all of the place for other ones. Whilst it&apos;s still new enough to feel fairly scary. I am no longer worried about a lack of work. It&apos;s true that I have no idea where I will be in a few weeks but that is all part of the excitement.\n\n## Why did I do it?\n\nSimply put, I was getting stuck in a rut in my old job. I have worked in the web industry since 1998 and over the years had developed a formidable set of skills, including front-end and backend development, print and web design, 3D modelling and copywriting. However whilst at my last permanent position, I was only a front-end developer. I never got the chance to use any of my other skills, at first it was fine, I loved (and still love) the company I was working for so I honestly didn&apos;t mind my scope being limited. In fact it was kind of nice to only be responsible for one area.\n\nI stayed with the company for three years. During that time, my front-end skills were solidified and honed but it was at the expense of my other skills. I tried to write a PHP application a few months ago and even though I managed to do it, it took me longer than it would have done a few years ago and it took a great deal of googling in order to re-learn some of the things which I had forgotten over the years.\n\nAs a contractor, I will have the opportunity to keep all of my skills fresh, I can choose roles based on which skills I want to work on at the time.\n\nThere are other, more obvious benefits to contracting of course, in two weeks at my current day rate, I have earned more than I would have earned in a month at my old salary, I get to meet new people all the time and best of all. I am my own boss. My current contract ends this friday and it&apos;s entirely up to me if I take another one starting the following week. I don&apos;t have to book holidays or worry about availability. I just decide not to accept any contracts for the period I wish to be off.\n\n## How have I found work?\n\nGenerally speaking, I&apos;m very much a &apos;measure twice, cut once&apos; sort of person. I will plan something to the nth degree before I will actually move forward. So, several years ago when I started working in my previous role. I decided that eventually, I would become a contractor. This is where my preparation process began. I signed up for LinkedIn and added anyone I worked with who I felt may be a useful person to stay in contact with in the future. I made sure that people in the digital industry knew who I was and over the course of three years. I gave myself a concrete network of people in the Leeds digital industry.\n\nWhen I became available for contracting it was simply a case of getting my website online, getting myself registered with a few key agencies (I&apos;ll speak more about those in my next post) and then making the announcement that I was available on social media sites.\n\nAll of this planning paid off as so far I have had three contract offers based on recommendation alone. Even though I am registered through the agencies, I have yet to use them, as my contract offers have all been direct. In fact, so far (although it is early days) I have not received a solid offer from an agency at all. Whilst I know a lot of contractors swear by agencies, so far all I&apos;ve seen is a lot of posturing. I&apos;m hoping that changes soon though as I suspect recommendations will only take me so far.\n\nThere are upsides and downsides to this of course. Getting &apos;in&apos; with an agency will make it much easier to find work during quiet periods, plus many agencies pay weekly so you don&apos;t have to worry so much about managing your cashflow or chasing clients.\n\nThe upside to going direct is purely a matter of money. I can command a higher day-rate if I go direct, in fact I would lose around 20% of my day-rate through an agent. Although I would say that given the option, I would still prefer to get work through a reputable agency as it feels more secure, somehow.\n\n## Do I have any advice to give?\n\nI think it&apos;s too early in my contracting career to start acting like an old salt and giving out advice. However I will say this, contracting is a great option for anyone with a valuable set of skills and the experience to back them up.\n\nHowever I wouldn&apos;t recommend quitting a well-paying and/or enjoyable job without putting some serious preparation time into it. Spend some time researching the market rates and availability for your skill-set, speak to other contractors, talk with an accountant and a solicitor so you understand exactly what you are getting yourself into and make sure people in your industry are familiar with your face. Go to networking events and industry social events. The more people who know your name and what you are capable of, the higher the chances that you will manage to keep the work flowing.\n\nAnd above all else... Good luck!",

                "title": "EventGhost - the little automation program which can change your life",
                "body": "Every now and again when scouring the internet for new and interesting information I find a tip or program (usually via the excellent [lifehacker.com](http://www.lifehacker.com/) website) which changes the way I live. EventGhost is such a program.\n\n\n\nEventGhost is definitely one of those programs. If you have a bit of intelligence and the (seemingly rare) ability to think laterally, it is possible to utilise EventGhost to revolutionise your home network or if you have a bit of money to spend on such things, your home itself.\n\nThe downside to this amazing tool is that it seems to be a relatively unknown program buried deep within a relatively unknown niche interest group (at least for now. It will gain ground soon enough as the technology become cheaper and it becomes simpler to use - which it will). As a result of this, finding information on how to get started can be daunting, even for someone who knows their way around PCs better than they do the real world. As a result of this I have put together a little guide for you. If it proves to be popular I may even start a semi-regular column (can you call it a column in a blog? sod it. It&apos;s my blog, it&apos;s a column)\n\nAs this is just an introduction to EventGhost there will be nothing particularly useful here, however I will create another article very soon about how to create a completely automated media centre using EventGhost and a few other free programs.\n\n## Step one: Find and install EventGhost.\n\nThis part is the easy part. Simply visit [eventghost.org/downloads](http://www.eventghost.org/downloads/) and download the latest release. Once downloaded follow the install wizard and your off.\n\n## Step two: Delete the examples\n\nThe stupidest part of the fresh EventGhost installation is the examples file. Its great to show people who are not terrified of computers what it can look like but the error messages it causes in the log panel will frighten most people off. Therefore as soon as Eventghost opens, go to 'File > New' and we'll start from scratch.\n\n## Step Three: Get to know the interface.\n\n![The Eventghost main interface](images/eg-1-1.jpg)\n\nNow we have a clean automation file the interface looks a little less daunting. As you can see there are two main panels. The larger panel on the left is your log panel. Everything that EventGhost is able to see will be logged in here. The smaller panel on the right is your event control panel. You can create, edit and delete events here as well as manage plugins.\n\nThe buttons from left to right are &apos;Add Plugin&apos;, &apos;Add Folder&apos;, &apos;Add Macro&apos;, &apos;Add Event&apos;, &apos;Add Action&apos;, &apos;Delete selection&apos;, &apos;Execute action&apos;\n\n## Step four: Making our first macro\n\nOk let&apos;s get down to the nitty-gritty here, this first tutorial will show you how to make a very simple macro which will automatically launch a program when you press a key combination (in this case alt+shift+1)\n\nThe first thing we want to do is to add a couple of plugins. So click on the &apos;add plugin&apos; button (![Add plugin button](images/image006.jpg)) and select &apos;Keyboard&apos; from the &apos;Remote receiver&apos; plugins folder.\n\n(note: As you have probably noticed at this point, EventGhost comes pre-installed with a LOT of plugins, in fact for the most part, you are unlikely to need to install new ones, if you do however then it is simply a case of copying the plugins folder into &apos;/program files/eventghost/plugins&apos; and restart the program.)\n\nAs soon as you have added the plugin you will notice that suddenly all the keystrokes you make are appearing in the logging panel. Now we are ready to create the action.\n\nAdding an action cannot be done directly, all actions need to be contained inside a macro, so to get ourselves a macro, click the add macro button (![Add macro button](images/image008.jpg)). Once you have done this you will be presented with this screen:\n\n![Eventghost 'Add Action' Interface](images/eg-2.png)\n\nThis is the &apos;add action&apos; window which makes EventGhost so amazing, as our intention is to launch a program (in this case it will be Spotify), select the &apos;Start application&apos; function under &apos;System&apos; then press &apos;ok&apos;. Then under &apos;executable&apos; browse to the executable file of the program you wish to launch. You may leave the other options blank as in this case they are not relevant. Once again, click &apos;ok&apos;.\n\nYou now have a macro which will open Spotify for you. Obviously at this point the only way to make it work is to manually execute it. So let&apos;s add an event. There are two ways to do this, the &apos;easy&apos; way and the &apos;hard&apos; way. So let&apos;s ignore the hard way and skip straight to the easy way.\n\n## Step Five: Generating events to attach to a macro.\n\nBy far the simplest way to generate an event is to do it yourself. As we will want alt-shift-1 to launch Spotify, simply press those keys now.\n\n![Eventghost Log](images/image012.jpg)\n\nAs you can see when you look into the log panel your keyboard combination is there as an event, so now simply drag the event into your macro above the action, like so:\n\n![Drag and drop example](images/image014.jpg)\n\nBelieve it or not, it is that simple, from now on (provided Eventghost is open of course) whenever you press alt-shift-1, you will launch Spotify.",

                "body": "Anyone who says a dog is a man&apos;s best friend never met Puddles. She was the most unique cat I've ever had the pleasure to know. Sadly last night she finally succumbed to her heart condition and had to be put to sleep. I miss her terribly and nobody will ever replace her. Let me tell you a bit about her.\n\n![A photo of my black cat, puddles peeking over my laptop screen.](https://res.cloudinary.com/foxleigh/image/upload/v1643717294/Puddles_e8bd402486.jpg)\n\nBack in 2000 I had a job I hated and I was just [starting to suffer with depression](/mind-body-and-soul/a-beginners-guide-to-depression/). I was not a very happy man, one night when I went to put the bins out; I saw a tiny little cat sat under one of the plastic chairs in my backyard. It was chucking it down and she seemed quite frightened. I had to go to work so I put a tarpaulin over the chair to make her a shelter and gave her some tuna. When I came back, she was still there; I told myself that if she were still there in the morning, I would let her inside.\n\nSure enough, she was, so I picked her up &emdash; she was visibly terrified but did nothing violent &emdash; and brought her inside.  Her fur was matted with dirt and she had a pink collar on which had clearly been put on her when she was much younger as she had grown around it, taking it off seemed to hurt her a little and I could see that underneath it, her fur had worn away (she still had a line in her fur where the collar had scarred her).\n\nI cleaned her up and gave her some more tuna and we've been best friends ever since.\n\n![A photo of my black cat, Puddles asleep with her head in my hand](https://res.cloudinary.com/foxleigh/image/upload/v1643722113/Puddles_sleeping_on_my_hand_f4df885e11.jpg)\n\nAt first she was incredibly timid, she spent 99% of her time hiding under my bed, after a while she'd come out a bit but only if I was around. Very slowly (probably about 3 years in total), she completely came out of her shell and started becoming a very sociable animal (except to other cats, whom she hated with a passion).\n\nYou could never meet a gentler creature, in the 14 years I had her, she never scratched anyone, not once. She didn't bite, she didn't hiss. She was just a happy, fluffy purr machine who was [slightly addicted to the smell of bleach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lXs_NIEtu8).\n\nDuring the peak of my depression, I&apos;d go as far as saying she saved my life, I knew that I couldn't do anything stupid as I couldn't leave her like that. She was always such a comfort to me whenever I needed her. We had our own little language (She would always respond to me, [it was often like we were having a conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L16sDkeUEA)) and our own little games. We always knew what the other one was thinking. The bond between us was incredible and I am devastated that I have lost that connection. I honestly feel like a part of me has died with her.\n\nEventually in 2013, I moved in with my girlfriend, Colette who Puds fell in love with immediately, whilst she does warm to people quickly, she isn&apos;t very good at accepting new people into her home on a permanent basis but she never minded at all with Colette. It was only a few months later that she was diagnosed with Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy which basically meant that the inside of her heart was shrinking and it had to beat faster and faster to keep her alive. We were told she had between 3 and 12 months to live (She managed almost 14).\n\n![A photo of my partner, Colette with my black cat, Puddles in her arms.](https://res.cloudinary.com/foxleigh/image/upload/v1643722113/Colette_and_Puddles_2a80c729da.jpg)\n\nMercifully she was practically symptom-free. She would occasionally cough and got out of breath once or twice but apart from that, she was as happy and contented as she had always been. In fact I suspect she was happier as we made sure that she was constantly spoiled in the last year of her life. We let her eat anything she wanted, we made sure she always had her favourite foods around her (tuna, prawns, chicken, custard, cottage cheese). We spent a lot of time with her (contracting allows me to be home during the day so she got more 'daddy-time' in the last year than she'd ever had).  She was scared of being outside alone but absolutely loved it when one of us was around. So long as she could see us, she'd be happy so [we took her to a field last summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzu5O5HVw18) for a run around, I don't think I've ever seen her look more bouncy.\n\nLast night, we went to bed after giving her some food (she still seemed as happy as usual), sat there for no more than 10-15 minutes when we heard a noise coming from downstairs, sometimes she gets scared at her coughs so I like to go down and cuddle her till she is calm, when I got downstairs I saw her lying still at the base of our sofa, she was clearly struggling to breath and appeared to have lost the use of her legs, occasionally she would arch her back and let out the most heartbreaking howl you have ever heard. Even now we don&apos;t know if she was in pain or if she was just terrified that she was unable to move.\n\nWe took her to the vets who informed us that sadly it seems, she had had the cat version of a heart attack and that there wasn't anything they could do and brought us through to say goodbye.\n\nShe had calmed down a bit and although she was still quite subdued and clearly still couldn't move her legs, she was aware we were there and seemed happy to see us. We gave her a big stroke and kissed her goodnight, and then she was put to sleep.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to really get across how amazing she was, I have never known another cat like her and I don't think I ever will since. I didn't lose a pet last night, I lost the most important living thing in the world to me, she was my little girl and my best friend and I am hurting more than I ever thought possible.\n\nI know the vast majority of you who read this, won&apos;t give a damn and probably never even made it to this paragraph. Don't worry though, I didn't really write this for you. I wrote it for me. I miss my little kitten and I want her back more than anything. My house feels empty now; there is nobody to greet us when we wake up in the morning or to tell us off for staying out too long when we come home. Our glasses of water will remain un-drank and our food untouched by a naughty little bugger who thought anything that was edible was for her and that thought fills me with more grief than anything else has ever done in my life.\n\n![A photo of my black cat, Puddles, sitting patiently at our outdoor dinner table waiting for her 'portion' ](https://res.cloudinary.com/foxleigh/image/upload/v1643722113/Puddles_at_the_table_6b30a8a1f5.jpg)\n\nSweet dreams my lovely Puds, I will miss you terribly. I wish more than anything that you were still here with me.",
